4.0,0.23,"I used this app for the first time last Friday and requested to pick up the next day. At first I was very worried of what would happen because I have always gone to the laundromat... well,1) this saves so much time!2) everything was folded so nice!3) everything felt super soft!4) everything never looked so good!The pricing was very reasonable. Why would other people complain about the price when your paying for convenience?This was my first time using it and I can't wait to send my laundry again in another week!It saves you sitting in the laundry for 2 hours and also saves money on detergent and it's delivered straight to your door!Download the app everyone! UPDATED REVIEW****Since my last review I have ordered it 3 times and they are still great! One day they picked this up at 8pm and it was back folded and clean in my hand at 8am the next day and I had a big heavy bag!Everyone should use this service! I no longer have to wait at the laundromat or even spend on detergent!"
1.0,0.2239,"Lost items, slow customer service (only available by email - the phones don't really work), and it's a hassle to get a reimbursement when you're missing clothes if you get a reimbursement at all. Not worth the steep price.I won't be using Cleanly again."
1.0,0.2306,"BEYOND TERRIBLE SERVICE. I'm not one to write reviews but I felt it necessary. This is the 5th time now I've had an issue with Cleanly services. Not once have they ever accommodated after each issue/damage. Customer service is pathetic. 1. Ripped and torn items (shirts, sheets)2. White duvet cover stained dark blue 3. Whites stained gray color 4. Requested and paid for overnight service and customer service replied 1 day later saying their driver was unable to complete the drop off and ultimately dropped off 3 days late - still charged for overnight fees.5. Most recently I received my white curtains heavily stained and ultimately had to throw them out (which I bought for $65) - at this time I was leaving on vacation for a week and did not report it until I returned. Customer service responded by saying ""since you reported after 7 day window we cannot do anything"" Needless to say, I will no longer use their services. They are unreliable and will end up costing you more money to replace your items that they damage. I recommend switching to ""FlyCleaners!!!!!"""
5.0,0.3526,"This was my first time using Cleanly. I decided to give it a try despite so many negative reviews online - that was mistake. I handed over 1 full size duvet cover, 1 full size fitted sheet and 2 standard pillow cases. The next day I received a text saying that my full size sheets did not fit in the washing machine and that they could not be hung dry. Therefore the two pillow cases would be washed and the sheets would be returned ""uncleaned.....""Huh? How are the washers  too small for standard full size sheets? The rinky-dink washers down my block can fit full sheets. Why could they not be hung dry? Again, they are standard full size sheets- not queen or King. Why accept full size sheets if you cannot actually wash or dry them?Lastly, I do not believe the pillow cases were even washed-- and ALL of the bedding came back crumpled, even the pieces that were not washed. This was an enormous waste of time. Just go through your local laundromat"
5.0,0.2276,Used cleanly again and they lost my entire bag of clothes. I will only get 10x what it cost to clean the clothes regardless of what it costs to replace them. Don't even know why I gave them a second chance.
0.0,0.2682,"****Updated review****I've attached 2 screenshots. Over 1 year, the price for washing bed sheets has went up $8 to $11, which is 37.5% mark up..... if you do the math. Their wash & fold price has also gone up 10 cent/lb now $1.6/lb. I literally just sent my laundry out 2 weeks ago in December 2018 and I can assure you it was $1.5/lb. It would be nice if customers were noticed of those price change. My #1 problem with cleanly is that they kept charging me extra, claiming the $2 bed sheets I got from Amazon deserves ""superior"" treatments. And each time I have to contact customer service to correct it. But how many people don't check their invoice or just don't give a fuck? I'm not even going to mention how many times cleanly misplaced my laundry items. Actually, the first time I used cleanly in 2017 summer, they lost my bf's brooks brother shirts! Yet I still decided to stick with cleanly. After returning to cleanly after taking a break and yet again, I found myself disappointed in cleanly's service. Nahhh fuck off cleanly, imma go & support local laundry mats. And this time I mean it! Whoever is reading this review, You should too."
5.0,0.2191,As per previous reviews absolutely horrible customer service constantly escalating things. Who are you escalating it to? Please give me a number of someone I can talk to that can make a decision. Also where are my clothes? They lost my bag completely. Absolutely appalling.
0.0,0.2588,"This is the WORST DRYCLEANING SERVICE IN THE HISTORY OF DRYCLEANING. Every single time I've sent something out there's been a problem. My beautiful gowns that barely were worn and needed a basic DRYCLEANING/steam are destroyed by yellowing, discoloration, dye problems. Another time 2 of my husbands $500 Tom Ford shirts went missing. Their policy is to reimburse you 3x the cost of the DRYCLEANING-- that's like $15. So yourself a favor and stay far far away from this joke of a company."
1.0,0.2538,"Well I'm writing this now in hopes I'll get some kind of reply. They took my clothes two nights ago and I was supposed to receive them all yesterday morning (paid for the overnight fee) and waited an hour past the window. They told me there was an issue with my card and I said run it again, there's no issue. There's no response from them. You get an automated chat on the app with computer answers rather than an actual human. They have all of my workout clothes, work clothes and underwear. Which is really fun. I've used them before with no problems so I'm extremely upset. I would rather just go to this holding facility they claim to have my stuff at and go get my belongings back myself. Would like a phone call and resolution ASAP...I'll update if I hear anything."

All automated systems. No responsibility on their end. Their insurance doesn't even come close to the value of the garments that are missing. WORST SERVICE IN NYC. DO NOT USE THEM!!!!

How the hell do you lose clothing like that when there's an app with the receipt they sent her!! And then because they lost or misplaced or whatever, they haven't decided if they are gonna reimburse for her clothes their delivery service lost!!!! WTF, we will never use them again!  DO NOT DO NOT USE THEIR DELIVERY SERVICES!!! Only if you want to get rid of clothes you don't want, they'll be glad to lose them for you!!! Disappointed and disrespectful!"
3.0,0.254,"This app is great. I can schedule easily, if it's midnight and I realize I need to have my laundry done, I don't have to wait until the next morning to call and schedule--I just open the app. I have lived in NYC since 1998, and laundry is a constant hassle. This makes it so easy. And having early morning and later evening hours for drop off and pick-up works so well for my busy schedule. I don't have a doorman, so this is especially important for me. They sort lights and colors. When the laundry comes back folded- it's grouped by type. All my T-shirts are together, all my underwear and socks are together- and so on. That makes putting the clothes away all the more simple. I haaate doing laundry, and I hate shlepping big bags of laundry around the street to & from the laundry. It's kind of pricey. I pay it because the convenience is worth it to me and the service is good."
2.0,0.2801,"Great idea, terrible execution. Don't waste your stress or time dealing with them. Go to your local laundromat.I used them for about 6 months and was very satisfied and now the problems are way too frequent. First, there was an issue with them honoring a credit I earned for taking a survey. It took about 6 emails back and forth to get it resolved. It should've taken 2. It was simple. They were supposed to credit my card back. Never did. I stopped using them because of that. Used a local laundromat. Just used them again for the first time since and they were late picking up my laundry by an hour and now they have to reschedule my drop off because the ""concierge has an emergency"" and they can't add me back to the drop off list. Really Cleanly? They seriously need to hire a management company to help them work through the kinks and fix their operations issues because after paying $50 for wash and fold, my expectations, as the paying customer, is to get what I paid for. Plus, I waited on hold for 30 minutes just to speak with someone.Now, if and when I get my clothes, because I'm sure there will be another issue, since they always have issues, I will be deleting the app and will not be giving them a third time to screw me over."
1.0,0.4027,"Long and short of it, from pick up to cleaning, somewhere in the process, Cleanly lost my suit.  I reached out to their customer service when it became apparent something was awry, as the suit had not delivered 3 days after the delivery date.  I was told they could not locate the item, and they would initiate an inquiry in which they would give themselves 10 days to find the suit.After 10 days, I reached out again, having heard nothing from their POC, who let me know that if they could not find it, they would only compensate me for 10x the cost of cleaning (approx $150 dollars), not the actual replacement value of the suit.  That is about an $800 dollar difference between those two numbers, without tailoring or other factors included.  When I had Nordstroms reprint the receipt, provided tags, etc, and they did not feel that warranted a different review.  This policy is not located on their Ap, nor is it anywhere to be found when you agree to their pickup/delivery.  Seeing as they have were not proactive in identifying the issue, they were unwilling to volunteer information as to the status of the inquiry and totally unwilling to work with me to provide the replacement value for an item, I would not recommend using this service."
2.0,0.2167,"TERRIBLE. My husband sent out 12 shirts to be laundered and pressed, they all came back wrinkled. Maybe if they buttoned them they would have not wrinkled during transport. This is awesome, because we both really want to spend all night ironing, can't wait to get started. Thanks cleanly!  Trying to call them, they aren't picking up, shoc.  We've had issues before with them, this is the last straw. After calling and sending photos, they REFUSE to give us a refund!!!   UNBELIEVABLE"
3.0,0.2183,"Lost my whole bag of laundry! Called cleanly 4 times and got hung up each time. Messaged them and was told that my valet already dropped off with a ""doorman"". I live in a townhouse there's no doorman! When asked where they brought my clothes and how to get in contact with the person that dropped it off at the wrong address, they completely ignored my questions and just told me to wait. My valet never called, and I never found out where my clothes was brought or how they manage to loose a whole bag of clothes."
1.0,0.2149,The worst customer service! The first bad experience I had with this company was when their delivery was 24 hours late and didn't get reimbursed for the wasted time. 2nd time was when I recently got my laundry back and one of my expensive shirts were ruined. I contacted cleanly and told them the situation. They said unfortunately they can't reimburse me for the shirt that THEY damaged. I would definitely go with another company.
3.0,0.3235,"I want to love Cleanly, I really do, but this latest fiasco has made me delete the app. When they get it right, they get it right. It's one of the few places that you could (in theory) count on unscented laundry detergent if that was your selection. Since I have fragrance sensitivity, that's a big deal. So I've dealt with their semi-frequent annoying screw ups (washing in scented detergent, charging for things they shouldn't charge for pretty much every order, etc). When they get it wrong, through: forget it. I'm done.For the second time, their concierge just had an ""emergency"" and they canceled my pickup at the last minute. I had scheduled a pickup and drop-off in plenty of time to have clean clothes to pack for a trip. I get a text right before pickup time saying, gee, sorry, they had an emergency and changed my pickup time to *after* I will be living on my trip. A back-and-forth with customer service was useless. So now I have to take two hours off work tomorrow to do laundry that I could have dropped off somewhere if Cleanly hadn't run out the clock. They deserve to go under. The customer service is the pits. Find another laundry app."
3.0,0.3216,"I've been a loyal member for years. To echo other reviewers, it really has gone downhill the past 3-4 months.I share the same experience of not being able to contact customer service because they don't pick up, and them rescheduling my drop off literally at the end of the drop off time window.Right now I'm on yet another call (15 mins on hold) because I'm flying to Buffalo and then Canada tomorrow morning and they have rescheduled my 8-9pm drop off window tonight to the next day for absolutely no reason. Now I have no gym clothes and only one pair of jeans to last me a whole week of travel. And my jackets are also held hostage by them. This is insane. I planned my drop off tonight for a reason, but this is not the first time I needed clothes and had them reschedule on me at the last minute. It's the last straw. After hundreds of dollars with them, I'm moving into an apartment with a washer and dryer on 6/1 and ditching them forever. I suggest you do too."
0.0,0.202,"Awful. They are CONSTANTLY losing your laundry. Terrible communication. I've had their customer service say, ""oh I remember you. We've lost your stuff before right?"" Seriously. Their delivery people will be the first to tell you how bad they are. I've used them for several months. Gave them more chances than anyone would. My only advice is just stay away. It's not worth it. One more thing, their excuse is that they are switching their delivery drives from ""consultants"" to full time employees. They have been using this excuse for MONTHS. Even the customer service rep I spoke to last time used it. And when I told her they always say that, she says d she knows and apologized again. Shame."
1.0,0.2523,"Horrible. I used them for a few months but have finally gotten fed up and decided to just go to a laundromat. tl;drTheir customer service is minimal, and you don't know what you've got til it's gone (with the clothing they lost)1) They provide no easy way to contact the people who are dropping off/picking up your clothes, so when they do things like forget to deliver some of your clothes, it becomes a huge ordeal to fix instead of a minor hassle. 2) They lost my clothes right before I went on vacation. Due to #1, this became a huge problem. That's also when I found out that their policy on their website is to reimburse you for no more than 10 times the cost of washing the item (cleanly.com/terms), which means the most you'll get back for a lost shirt that you ordered hang dry ($1 charge) is $10. 3) They provide no clear customer service information on their website. If you dig long and hard you can find a phone number on some page, but there are no customer service hours posted. You won't find out you're calling after hours until you're on hold with their inane hold music for an hour--when no one picks up, it just keeps you on hold forever. 4) They don't return the bags you send out. I used to get hang dry service, then the cleaners stopped returning the hang dry bags. When I eventually contacted customer service they told me they were no longer using hang dry bags, there's just a special pocket inside the normal laundry bag--but they didn't have any more normal bags they could deliver to me and wouldn't have them for another week or two.5) They're frequently delayed when delivering clothing and they need to reschedule, especially if you try to get them to deliver in the morning."
5.0,0.2441,"Astounding amount of waste for just a few dry cleaned shirts. Completely unnecessary paper, and they should deliver in reusable bags (perhaps charge you if you don't return it next time with dirty shirts). At the very least they could group the shirts.Look at this nonsense! Unacceptable."
3.0,0.2515,"DO NOT USE - They are the FYRE Festival of laundry delivery services. Build it and advertise it now and figure out how to actually make it function later.I will NEVER use Cleanly again and don't recommend it if you'd worry if your laundry goes missing. I had a HORRIBLE experience the first time I used them and would give zero stars if possible. Next time I will just drop off my laundry at the local laundromat down the street.Here's what happened: I paid extra for rush service. A friendly guy picked up the laundry on time in the morning and it was due back that evening between 8-9. At 8:25 I got a text that it had been delivered but it hadn't been. When I tried to call them to clarify, I was on hold for an hour. When a rep picked up, he heard my complaint and then pretended not to be able to hear me, like the connection was bad, and then hung up on me! I tried to use their chat support and the rep wasn't very helpful, saying the laundry had been delivered when it clearly was lost. Finally, he got word that the laundry was still in fact at their vendor's facility and couldn't be delivered until 8 PM the next day. (I had sent my bed sheets, so this was a huge bummer!)They then charged my credit card AGAIN for the new delivery and didn't cancel the first charge or refund the rush service fee.The customer service was AWFUL and unapologetic, and they're not reliable. I would only trust clothes/sheets I really don't care about seeing again with them."

They have since lost my dry cleaning and are extremely slow to respond via their customer service channels. They actually tried to hide the fact that the dry cleaning was misplaced by delaying the return of the full order. My laundry was returned 24 hours after it was promised, but the dry cleaning is no where to be found. What's worse, I've only received canned responses with multi-day lags between emails. In fact, I only got an acknowledgement of the problem after tweeting at them directly. It is now 8 days later, and I am still waiting for a response as to the two dresses that are lost. I understand that mistakes happen but their utter refusal to acknowledge the problem is utterly infuriating. I only want my items returned. Maybe by seeing this post the customer service team will actually respond to their email. Do not use this service."
1.0,0.2131,Pretty much the worst. Terrible customer service response times. They lose a good amount of your laundry
3.0,0.3886,"I never write reviews, especially negative ones, but my experience was so overwhelmingly negative I feel the need to save other people the hassle. The entire purpose of this service is convenience but they fall well short of that. Save yourself the time, money, and stress. I work a lot, travel, and live alone so I wanted to try this out because I was rarely home when the laundromat near me is open - I leave home before 6 am and usually don't get back until after 8 or 9. Cleanly ended up making laundry even more frustrating. I'd rush back only to have them cancel my pick up. My ""hang dry"" clothes were returned soaking wet (like actually dripping). The app wouldn't acknowledge my change requests. My Cleanly bag and clothes were returned smelling like stale cigarettes. The final straw for me was this week after returning from a trip and desperately needing my laundry done before returning to work less than 12 hours after a long 36-hour trip home. I scheduled three different pick up windows and all were either cancelled (after an hour of waiting PAST the pickup window) or they didn't show up prompting me to cancel and be charged a fee. I was charged several times as a ""no show"" when I was home (concierge didn't even bother to follow the instructions for buzzing up to my apartment) and I only had one successful pick up / drop off in 2 months where I didn't have to reschedule more than once due to the concierge being late. I always tried to schedule pick ups before I leave for work and ended up being late when waiting for them to show up. Honestly can't say a single positive thing other than I am *fairly* certain none of my clothes were lost. Then again, I guess it's hard to lose them if you never come pick them up."
5.0,0.301,"I've used Cleanly twice, once smoothly without a hitch and once as if I was in a never-ending nightmare of lost laundry. This is the story of the latter. Here's the summary: Cleanly picked up 2 bags of laundry from me, one with my shirts to be dry cleaned, another with laundry to be washed. I had 20-30 shirts and about 30-40lbs of wash and fold laundry (I suck at doing laundry regularly..hence trying Cleanly despite mixed reviews). A day goes by and I receive a text message (July 30) from the fulfillment center saying they can't immediately locate my laundry. Later, after an hour on the phone, Cleanly confirms that they've lost my bag with the 30-40lbs of wash and fold (thank god I didn't lose every dress shirt I've ever worn..trying to stay positive). They ask as ""corporate policy"" for a 10 business day time window to investigate during which they wouldn't even talk about reimbursement. I ask them to reimburse me at least for socks & underwear I have to buy to bridge me the 10 days...denied. Finally on Aug 16, I get a quote for reimbursement....at a rate of 10 times the cost to wash (ie. at the $1.50/lb rate for wash and fold, I would get $15 dollars for every pound of clothes lost). To put in perspective, this is the equivalent of a car wash compensating someone $150 for completely destroying/losing their car. If that wasn't enough, they quote me for 17lbs of clothes, ~ half of what the bag actually weighed. When I ask for specific internal documentation on the actual weight of the bag, Cleanly quickly attributed the prior weight quote as ""human error"" and agreed to compensate me for 30lbs, what I thought my clothes weighed in the first place. The question I would ask before using Cleanly are these - Is the convenience worth it for the risk of losing your entire wardrobe and receiving almost no compensation? Do you want to do business with a company that obviously tries to get away (fraudulently in the case of my weight quote) with paying less for reimbursement? As is always the case, you never see someone's true colors until things go south. My situation is still in dispute. I am currently seeking to file my case in New York Small Claims Court. My back-and-forth with Cleanly documenting the ordeal is below. You can decide for yourself if the risk is worth taking."

Now, I've been patiently waiting for the Cleanly person to come pick up my clothes. I got a notification that they're on the way. The tracker showed them about a mile away. I then noticed an email from Cleanly saying I was a no show for the pickup, but the email said they're waving the $5 fee. I can't believe how quickly the service has gone down hill."

After ten business days - the amount of time they deemed appropriate to conduct Clothes Hunt 2018 - we followed up to no response. After some pestering, they clarified that it's ""10 business days."" Ha, how silly of us. Yes, enjoy your weekend. I'll be sitting on a couch wearing those boxers that always stay at the back of your drawer but you don't throw away because one day you might need them. Yeah, I've needed clothes like that a lot lately.So 10 business days goes by. Nothing from them. AND they ignore all of our texts, emails and calls. Nice! Finally, 11 business days later, we get a text that someone will reach out ""in the next 24 to 48 hours.""

True garbage humans. We get it, you're real scummy and we shouldn't have trusted you. Get on with it.

We just spent two weeks and they're like, ""aaaah, we're gonna guess we lost, like, 20 pounds? Good round number, let's go with that.""People, they lost more than 20 pounds. It tells you that IN THEIR APP.  They certainly lost more than $300 worth of clothing. Am I referring mostly to my girlfriend's nice outfits and not my crap? Yes, but that's beside the point.In all of this, they HAVEN'T REFUNDED THE ORDER. They took our $50, lost our clothes, did nothing for two weeks, ballparked the amount of stuff they lost, reminded us that their terms let them pay you chump change and then expected us to go, ""Well thanks for the effort!""No joke, this is the final line of the email they sent us.""I hope this is a positive solution.""Holy chriiiiiiist the audacity.

1.0,0.256,This company is shady AF to say the least.

But something's gone wrong.... I had an order cancelled on me because they are ""at capacity"". Then, during my rescheduled appointment, they cancelled on me during the pick up hour.

This week they messed up the order and lost our bag and sent another thing that is not ours. So f*ed up.Also, they take forever to answer emails or calls (they say they need 10 business days if they loose your clothes).If you like your clothes, don't trust this service with them."

That being said, dry-clean prices are out of control. I'd recommend taking those items elsewhere.My only issues have been with customer service - when you need to reach out, responses can take longer than I think is appropriate given the nature of the service."

3.0,0.2722,"I've used Cleanly for more than a year and had mostly good experiences.  I've not had any issues with wash & fold and laundered shirts; no missing or damaged items during that time.  The only hiccup was the wrong laundry bag being returned but customer service was quick to resolve the issue.  App is pretty good but can be buggy on occasion.If there are issues, it is usually with pickup and delivery.  Scheduling pick ups, in particular, can be difficult if you don't plan a few days ahead as many morning time slots seems to book up fast, especially towards the end of the week.  They also recently reduced the number of pick up windows in the AM; previously you could pretty much select any hour between 630am to 10am.  Now, you can only choose between 630am and 730am or 730am and 930am.  2 hours is a large chunk of time to wait without knowing when they might arrive.  Deliveries are occasionally plagued with late drop offs but this seems less frequent recently.  All in all the convenience has outweighed any of the issues."
3.0,0.251,"Generally a really good service! Wash/fold and dry clean services are great. Three stars are for late deliveries/pick ups. Have had ~5  instances in the past 2 months where my pick up or drop off were 30-90 minutes, causing frustration and and me needing to adjust my plans. Have also had pick up arrive early and get mad at me when I wasn't available to give them my laundry early.Will continue to use though, but think some Ops can be improved!"
3.0,0.3017,"Great idea, mediocre execution. I've given Cleanly several chances to get it right, and I give up.  I think maybe 1-2 orders out of 3-5 have met expectations.  And by expectations, I mean the ones Cleanly sets: use an app, someone picks up your dirty laundry during the specified time window, cleans it, and returns it in the specified time window about a day later.  This time, no one picked up my laundry during the AM time.  I had to contact them to tell them, as they thought they had. Even though it was only 30 min after the time slot, they couldn't pick it up until late that night.  Of course, that also meant my clothes wouldn't be back the next morning, but the next evening.  Annoying. Then, my doorman informed me that Cleanly took one bag, not both bags.  I got a text from Cleanly at 11pm (I was already asleep) because they were confused about what clothes to wash and hang dry.... since that was the bag they left at my building.  It's a stupid system of bags and they don't tell you that you're ""supposed"" to put the hang dry bag inside the wash/fold bag.  Gee, I figured having the bags on top of each other would make it obvious there were two. It was impossible to respond to the text, or click on the link it provided to clear things up.  Then I saw in the app that my delivery was delayed again to the next day (today).  So I emailed to explain and express my disappointment and irritation at the poor service and communication. I asked for my clothes back unwashed, if they weren't going to be able to actually meet the new delivery time.Sure enough, dirty clothes back in my lobby this morning.  Never use them again, so unreliable."
4.0,0.2817,"Cleanly is great - it is so much easier to have your laundry picked up and delivered door to door than lugging it a few blocks and spending hours in a laundromat every time you need to wash your sheets.I think their pricing for blankets and duvet covers is a little high, but their wash and fold pricing is reasonable and consistent with what you might pay at a regular laundromat. Cleanly has made y life a lot easier overall!"
3.0,0.2984,"App has a great UI and is very straight forward on ease of use. The laundry itself has come back in good condition, no complaints there. It's saved me a lot of time as even though I have a washer/dryer combo it takes forever to run a single load. My only issue is sometimes pickup has come 10-30 minutes earlier than the time listed and I may not be home which they seem to get annoyed with which is also annoying on my end as sometimes the windows selected are already 90 minutes wide.But overall though it's an easy to use service which saves me time, costs a fraction of that time I would have spent on laundry and has enabled me to do all my laundry in a quick turnaround. I travel a lot for work and the last thing I want to do when I get home from a trip is laundry, especially when I have to leave again in 48 hours."
3.0,0.2778,"Up until now I liked this service. Yesterday my delivery was rescheduled and I assumed it was due to the cold and not having enough drivers. I totally understand. I rescheduled for today between 8-10am. My buzzer went off, I buzzed in and waited for my clothes and the delivery never came upstairs. I soon got notification that I missed my appointment, was charged and would need to reschedule for this evening. I am leaving on a work trip and I need my clothes ASAP. I tried calling and emailing and the response so far has been to see if they can get my clothes delivered not when. I splurged and spent $72 to have my laundry taken care off specifically so I could have everything in order for my work trip. This is absolutely unacceptable."
2.0,0.214,"Prices are OK, and they haven't lost any of my items after using them for about a year, however:1. They'll cancel or reschedule your order at their whim while you're at home waiting for your order to be picked up or delivered. Sometimes the new pickup or delivery will be days later. I've had all of my bedding and a significant number of clothes out for a cleaning and then been told that I would not be getting them back until 24-36 hours after I was scheduled to receive them. You don't get any sort of account credit for this, which is the least they could do.2. Customer service is basically non-existent. They have a phone number  which seems to always have an infinite wait time. They don't respond to customer support emails.3. For some reason their service has gotten worse this year: clothes are no longer folded properly, items are thrown together randomly instead of things like socks being kept together, and the benefits for the Cleanly Reserve membership were significantly reduced."

They called me when they arrived to pick up my laundry while I was using the restroom. I called them back within two minutes, the guy answered and said he already left??? He said he called me when he was in front of the building, but was long gone now. I told him he couldn't possibly be far away because I called him back in two minutes, but he didn't care. He was also very rude and even hung up on me. I wish I would have read other reviews before trying this company out. Worst customer service I have received in years. Cleanly has left me in a bad position right before Thanksgiving as I needed this service done before catching a flight. I will be sure to tell everyone I can to not use this flaky, unreliable service."

They ended up, a month after my previous review and giving them 1 star reviews on all other rating platforms, trying to give me $15 of credit for the inconvenience to try them again, which I honestly was astonished by. They basically valued all my wasted time at $15.I will thank Cleanly for one thing however. Because they forced me to shop around, I found good ol' WashClubNYC; who was waiting to provide this service as it should be.I didn't realize how bad even Cleanly's good days were, but now I see the light. After 3 months of using WashClub (about 15 orders, ordering from Brooklyn Heights), I have enjoyed:1. No missing clothing2. Regular weekly pickups, deliveries within a day (you can schedule morning of or night before without having to wait 2+ days for a pickup).3. A 'regulars' discount.4. Only 1 time, that service was delayed by a 12 hour window (night delivery was cancelled and they delivered next morning for me, delivery fee waved).5. Oxi-clean, color-safe-bleach, and cheaper rates!6. And last but certainly not least: COMPETENT, friendly couriers. The only thing I'll say that stinks is Cleanly's app was nicer to look at, but hey, I'm not paying for a nice app! :) If you want better service check WashClubNYC out: washclubnyc.com/?aid=137…"

1.0,0.3632,"Don't recommend for nice clothing! As a PSA, if they ruin an item (i.e. I recently had five pieces of dry cleaning accidentally put through the wash), they have an internal policy that dictates they can only refund you 10x the cost of cleaning. So if you get an expensive dress or tux dry cleaned and it gets damaged accidentally, they'll only reimburse you based on the cost to clean, not the value of the item. I wasn't aware of this till after having items damaged and I definitely wouldn't have given them those items to begin with had I know the policy. Have also had friends have their entire order misplaced and Cleanly requests 20 days to try and locate the lost order before beginning a reimbursement process... that's almost a month without your clothes back and no payment for the items you'll probably have to buy in the meantime."
5.0,0.3049,"I've used them for years and was decently happy with them until a few months ago. A few (expensive) items that were put in the hang-dry bag did NOT come back hang-dried. I'm talking those expensive Rails shirts that go for $200 a pop. As always, I made sure my order showed that there would be hand-dried (am I using this right tense with this?) items, but I thought something was off when I received my emailed bill later that night where it didn't include hang dry. After a quick call to confirm everything was okay and my clothes would be properly taken care of, they assured me all was fine. Unfortunately this was not the case when my laundry was returned and my shirts were not only shrunk, but pulled. After some back and forth, they offered me $70 (mind you there were two shirts ruined..around $400 retail price). I understand their policy under the circumstances where it would be the individuals fault for not properly addressing certain types of clothing, but I made it clear AND called customer service to confirm there would be no confusion. Such a shame. If anyone cares, I'm a size small in Rails long-sleeve button down flannel shirts. Ugh."
5.0,0.3399,"I started using Cleanly laundry services this past summer. What encouraged me to use Cleanly was the promo code that gives you $10 off your first 3 orders. After signing up, I was offered a trial for 1-week or 30-month Cleanly Reserve membership which gives you benefits such as waived delivery fee, 12 free hang-dry items, a few waived no-show fees, and several free rush deliveries. It's a pretty awesome way to start! The actual valet service itself was decent. With each order you place, you get a personal valet who comes directly to your door to collect your items- no matter how light or heavy. There hasn't been a time where my valet was late or didn't show up, they'd always come in the scheduled hourly window. When you place your first order, your valet brings you your FREE laundry bag, garment bag, and hang-dry bag.  Last but not least: the actual laundry service. I chose my laundry settings to be of warm wash, low-dry, scented detergent, and softener. These instructions seem to have been followed well so far. When your laundry is brought back to you, your washed and folded clothes are put in a large clear plastic bag and then placed inside the original wash and fold bag  (so that the clean clothes aren't touching the dirty). Your dry-cleaned items would be professionally placed inside the designated garment bag as well. The folding clothes were done decently. I could honestly say that I'd do a better job, but it's nothing to complain about. The overall smell was less than how I usually want it. It's obvious that my clothes are being washed and cycled, but I can't smell the Downy softener that the company says they use...but then again, it may be because the clothes are placed in a plastic bag overnight. Again, nothing to really complain about. The overall service of Cleanly is decent. I'd say if you're looking for an affordable and lazy way to do laundry, give this a try and take advantage of the promos and free trials. $1.50/lb clothes and $6.50 for dry clean blouses/pants are the prices I've paid so far for my laundry."

But yet Cleanly changed my 7:30 am pick up time at midnight, and I stayed home that day specifically for them to pick it up. They didn't offer me anything for that change but they charge you when you make a change. Cleanly is actually the worst."
1.0,0.4428,"I wanted to send a message to everyone struggling with Cleanly losing their items: File a business complaint with the NYC government, the NY Attorney General, and the BBB and go to small claims court, if necessary. Dry cleaners have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the items entrusted to them, and if they fail to do so, consumers are entitled to seek recourse. Don't let Cleanly screw you over without a fight. Here are links for small claims court:nycourts.gov/courts/nyc... www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resourc...Also, you should use the ""International Fair Claims Guide for Consumer Textiles"" to build your case. It is a written standard drycleaners should hold themselves to. It will help you determine what they are liable for and how much you should be compensated for each item.Here is the link for the guide: gandwcleaners.com/Fair%2... (If the link doesn't work, you can just Google it)Lastly, while Cleanly's compensation policy for lost items limits compensation to 10x the cost of cleaning the item, that policy is incorporated in a limitation of liability clause. The enforceability of such clauses is not absolute in instances of negligence."

It's been 2 months since they lost my order that I've been trying to deal with their incompetence, and now neglect, and they continue to demonstrate no accountability. In short, Cleanly is complete garbage.Here's a detailed timeline to provide a more tangible sense for their bullshit:* 6/30: Cleanly picked up my laundry as scheduled via the app (dry cleaning + wash & fold). * 7/2: This was the originally scheduled dropoff date, but they notified me 1 hour before scheduled delivery that they weren't able to make it, and automatically rescheduled for 7/3. I told them 7/3 wouldn't work because I was flying out of town for the week; Cleanly said tough shit, so I had to reschedule for when I was back in town on 7/8.* 7/8: Dropoff attempt #2-- Cleanly again failed to deliver during my scheduled window and tried to reschedule for some random time I wouldn't be home, so I had to reschedule for next day.* 7/9: Cleanly finally drops off my wash & fold, but my entire dry cleaning order is missing. I notify Cleanly via text and email immediately.* 7/26: 17 days pass of Cleanly claiming over email that they're looking for my order and also asking, 'durrrr, did you find your items?"" NO, BECAUSE THEY WERE NEVER DELIVERED. Finally they email me back on this day: ""It is our aim to resolve this matter as quickly as possible and we will have a supervisor contact you with reimbursement options in the next 3-5 business days.""* Today (9/1): Still haven't received a single communication from Cleanly since they told me they'd contact with reimbursement options, in spite of my email follow-ups and calls.Their phone line has put me on hold anywhere from 20-45min+ at a time before hanging up with an automated message claiming Support would contact me. Have they delivered on this promise? NOPE.Cleanly is totally unreliable and lacks any sort of accountability.

The few times I did get my stuff back, my clothing was rust stained, musty smelling and stapled through.They've lost hundreds of dollars of my clothing and after two months of working with their customer service (and following up daily), Cleanly would only reimburse me for the items I had receipts for... which is ridiculous since it took them over two months to admit they lost the items, this after lying about the delays. They tried to say there was a weather problem, that my clothes needed ""extra time"" and finally that the drivers were all busy. Between the time spent waiting for false deliveries and contacting customer service, I'm out thousands of dollars. They're liars with a pretty app -- they literally lost 14 items and pretended it was due to snow storm. Do not waste your time or money."

They didn't deliver the next night as promised,  and I had to spend a considerable amount of time trying to get them to tell me they would deliver the next morning. I was given a $5 credit only after insisting I deserved recompense for my inconvenience.  $5. The clothes were clean, the folding was ok, not on the lines of the clothes. Folded however."

Over the past couple of months my deliveries keep getting rescheduled or the valet just doesn't show up to my apartment. I feel it's become unreliable, I had a pick up scheduled for this morning and a drop off scheduled for tomorrow evening as I'm going on vacation the next day. They just texted me to let me know my laundry will now be dropped off in 3 days causing me to just go with another company. They haven't lost any of my clothing like some of the other reviews but they did reimburse me for a dress that I had just bought that got ruined during dry cleaning. They also gave me someone else's clothes once (along with mine.) I feel like it's good to get out now before anything else bad happens (like losing my entire bag of laundry!)"

Recently (specifically since they moved over to the concierge model and rebranded) the service has gone down hill.  I don't write reviews often, but I'm so frustrated with this service that I need to warn against those who are looking into it. My last 3 orders I received a notification 10 minutes towards the end of my time slot (they offer scheduled, one hour time slots) saying due to traffic my drop off will be delayed. It just kept happening. Previously I got a notification my laundry had arrived when it hadn't and I had to wait another hour for them to bring the laundry they never dropped off. Today, I didn't receive a notification. 10 minutes after the order should have been received I reached out. Apparently my order never even left! Which is funny since I got a notification to get ready. The response time to my questions is so slow that I have no clue at this point when I should receive my order. I may be getting it tomorrow morning but who knows! the customer service rep was not specific, she said ""morning"". Never have I been offered a discount during all the issues I've had. After waiting all night for my order they only offer 20% when that's similar to their into package? Who knows if I'll ever get my order! Do. Not. Use. This. Service."

Every time I indicate that I want certain items to be hang dry I get a text asking where the items are. Um they are in the pocket that says ""hang dry?!""

Universe, you're hilarious!!Cleanly lost about 40+ items of clothing including my 2 favorite pairs of jeans, dresses, tee shirts, work out clothes, a bathing suit and essentially all my socks and underwear. Cleanly took nearly 3 weeks to finally let me know that my things were not coming back and lowballed me on what they would reimburse me at first (not to mention 2.5 weeks after our stuff was lost they still hadn't even refunded the $42 that the order cost). I had to trick Cleanly into calling me back during this process by using numbers that they didn't recognize and got to the point where I wasn't sure they would stay true to their reimbursement terms because I was getting no response at all. Will they wash your stuff? Sure? Will they bring it back? Who knows!

But to echo the other reviewers, their service has really gone downhill the past few months. And my experience today is the straw that broke the camels back. I will no longer be using Cleanly ever again!! Long story short, I had originally scheduled a pickup for Saturday morning. However, valet was an hour late and I couldn't wait any longer. I contacted customer service and they rescheduled me for Saturday evening pickup, and Sunday evening drop off. Flash forward to Sunday evening, my street is closed off due to UN general assembly. I proactively reach out to Cleanly informing them of this and that I was even willing to meet the valet downstairs to pickup my laundry because I knew parking would be a challenge. NO RESPONSE from customer service. 30 minutes later, I see my valet is on the other side of town. After finally reaching customer service, they informed me that valet couldn't find parking and they had to reschedule the drop off. WTF, I had contacted them just to avoid this situation. After much firm language, they finally agree to send the valet back to drop off luggage but I had to go to the street corner to chase down my luggage. This isn't the first time this has happened to me and after each time, there are no apologies, rumination or even acknowledgement that they are in the fault. This is a terribly run business. I will no longer be spending money with them and I suggest you do the same."

If something goes wrong (and it went very, very wrong), they don't respond to you over email, you can't reach them over the phone (you are on hold until you get to a recording saying they can't take your call and there is no opportunity to leave a voicemail), and you can't reach them in person since there is no address available. I've been using this service for around 2 years. I've noticed certain items going missing but never frequently or noticeably enough that I followed up with them on anything. Last week I had dry cleaning and wash & fold done. I was home for the delivery and while they didn't knock, I heard it being dropped off outside my door. When I opened the door the delivery person was gone and only my dry cleaning was there, not my entire bag of wash & fold. I spent the next 5 days emailing and calling them and the only response I got (on day 2) was an email saying that it must have been left in the warehouse and they would try to locate it and arrange for its delivery. Since then, I haven't been able to get anyone from the company to reply or answer the phone. I filed a claim with my insurance company who also has not been able to get a hold of them. I also filed a police report for stolen items."

My only issues: On my first order it says you will receive 3 Cleanly bags for dry cleaning, hang dry and regular wash although I only received 1 unmarked black laundry bag (which is fine because that's all I need but still). My only other issue is that usually in the morning for pickup each time they have been late. I always get a text saying ""Traffic is bad, your cleanly concierge is running 45 minutes late"".

All my clothes were nicely cleaned and pressed when I received them back. The price is very reasonable especially considering it's a dry cleaning delivery service in the city (I got 20% off for my first order, and I don't think there was delivery fee at all, though I imagine I will be charged with delivery fees in future orders). I saw some negative reviews here about losing items and not being able to get reimbursed which sounds horrible.

I had added several discount codes to their app, and then they never honored them, but honestly I just let it go because I'm busy. It's obviously overpriced so I tried to use them rarely anyway, and now I know why there are so many bad reviews here.

Expensive clothing unfortunately because that is what you dry clean. A $250 dollar dress, ruined. Another dress, way too shrunken to wear and can't be replaced. Countless others that were clearly marked in the dry cleaning bag. I'm heartbroken because two of the dresses just can't be replaced anymore.

Then there were even bigger issues, they never returned or laundry bag and instead gave us a generic black one which I can only assume is another customer's. Eight pairs of my brand new underwear from Victoria's Secret came back completely torn (how does that happen??), and there was a pair of underwear that's not even mine in my laundry! When I contacted them about all the torn clothes, they said there was nothing they could do because I didn't indicate to dry on low heat, which I've never had to do in the past and had no issues.

They had all my sheets and I had absolutely no more clean work clothes left, so this was seriously a disaster. My delivery guy had texted me earlier thankfully, and apparently he still had my bag with him! Management said he wasn't allowed to return my belongings until the next day which made NO sense to either of us, and thankfully my deliverer was a reasonable human being who bent the rules to help me have a bed to sleep in and clothes to wear. THAT SAID, management instantly began to ignore me after I told them that their policy did not make sense, and I heard NOTHING from management until TWO DAYS later.

I sent the link to the dress and asked if they would reimburse me for the actual cost of the item because I would need to replace it, and they told me that ""while they take responsibility"" they ""can't be sure they had the dress"" so they wouldn't be able to make an exception. Basically, you can't dry clean your expensive items and anything you launder should be less than about $30 because that is all they will pay you when they eventually lose something. This policy is absurd - I understand having a per item reimbursement cap but you lost the full item, I need to replace the full item, so this is nothing more than just a gesture.9/14 - cleanly lost my bathing suit top and after over three weeks and 15 business days (their policy is 10 and I checked in repeatedly and got ""we are still looking"" emails) they said the value of my bathing suit was $15 (it was NOT). Pretty crappy."

I've used the service off/on for two years and they've only gone down hill.

Maybe never?"

I asked the delivery man if he could wait until I confirmed I got the right laundry this time and he said, ""Yeah, they've been losing a lot of peoples laundry lately.""  Good business idea, very poor execution.

The app is so amazing and I like that it shows where my valet is and when to expect them.There was one time we had a shirt dry cleaned and after that became very brittle but I am not sure if that anything to do with Cleanly's service.I will definitely continue using this service, until I am shown any reason not too."

They keep telling me to check the front desk but I have several times, I have even looked through the entire package room and there is nothing there! The customer service is horrible, they put you on never ending hold and the system hangs up on you after you have been on hold for 5 minutes. They also never call you back.

5.0,0.2952,The worst. Stay away. Delivery and pickup is always delayed so you cannot depend on scheduling your day around them. We have had very expensive custom made shirts go missing. We have had holes ripped in shirts and buttons ripped off.  We have had deliveries simply not show up and suddenly appear a few days later because they were rescheduled without us knowing. We have had clothes slated for wash and fold be moved to dry cleaning with excessive fees. We have had clothes come back dirtier than they were sent. And to top it all off we have the premier reserve membership and still get sub par treatment. Cleanly will not allow cancelation or prorated membership FYI. I will wear dirty clothes before I send to cleanly again.

I email them almost daily to call me to help solve this problem (they have no phone number that I can just call). They've set up several times to call me and each time the call request ""didn't go through.""

I'd rather all just be clean without some awful scent but that's not an option. They decide what you're getting and when (and if!) you're getting it back. Almost impossible to contact.

4.0,0.3783,"I love first-class service. I especially love first-class service when it includes delivery/pickup straight to/from my door, and I love it even more when the result of the service is top-notch and first-class in itself. I heard about Cleanly thanks to the power of social media ads and tried it on a whim. I was going away for the weekend and didn't have time to do my laundry beforehand. Cleanly came to the rescue; they picked up my bag of wash-and-fold laundry and delivered the clean laundry two days later, at my request.I'm a graphic designer who works primarily in packaging design so I have deep respect when it comes to the wrapping and packaging of things. That being said, I've never seen anything packaged as pristinely as my folded clothing post-Cleanly. The laundry was folded in one perfectly neat stack and sealed tightly in plastic, then wrapped inside a thick, durable Cleanly laundry bag. In one compact stack the laundry was separated by clothing category, sort of how you might imagine a laundry layer cake if a laundry layer cake was a thing: sweatpants, t-shirts, workout clothing, yoga pants, sports bras, undergarments, socks. I put the perfect stack on my bed and took a photo to sent to all my friends who appreciate perfect things.Since that one fateful whim, I've sent out my laundry for Cleanly's wash-and-fold service a few times before going away on trips. I've also used their dry cleaning service and my clothing has returned as fresh as can be.The customer service at Cleanly is also first-class: you receive text messages when your order is picked up and underway, as well as notifications when it's dropped off. If Cleanly has any questions, they send a quick text to confirm things with you before proceeding. Also, the Cleanly app is A++, gorgeously designed, easy to navigate, et al. Life is too short to stay up until 1am doing your own laundry when you have a train to catch early the next morning for a 3-day trip; instead, catch some Zzz's and send your laundry out to Cleanly. You'll have sweet, sweet detergent dreams."

So very first go with Cleanly, and they lost a mountain of clothes with little to no follow up, assurance or customer service."

They do a great job with wash and fold, laundry service etc.I've only had them run late one time and I was very clearly communicated with and the delivery fee was refunded right away.The only reason this is not a 5 star service for me is because it is definitely not cheap. I've had bags of laundry that were less than half full and it will cost me $30 - yikes!Overall, a great service and I will continue to use for small loads :)"
2.0,0.2173,"I've been using Cleanly for a few months now, and it's been a phenomenal addition to my life. The clothes are always folded crisply, and with attention to detail - I love how the socks and other small items are separated from the rest of the laundry. The timeliness is usually on point as well. I've only had one or two issues with tardiness; one was only 10-15 minutes late, and another was 30 minutes late, but the delivery person seemed to have a physical ailment so I didn't have an issue. When I've needed rush delivery, that has been solid as well.Someone else mentioned that the fabric softener smell isn't as pronounced. That's true, but I never would have realized that if I hadn't read it, so I didn't allow that to detract from my score. There have also been a couple times where it's been more expensive than I assumed it would be, but not obscenely so. It's not like I weigh the laundry myself before sending it off, and the results are usually good enough for me not to care. I've been considering using the VIP, and I've been considering using the dry cleaning option. But I've also been considering taking my own control and doing my own laundry, haha. Still a great service though, and one I'm comfortable recommending."
0.0,0.2152,"I consistently use Cleanly and like them, but that's because I take certain precautions with ANY sort of drop-off laundry service in New York. I also consider them better than other drop-off companies like Flycleaners, which didn't have as many services. Cleanly also gives you a free set of nice laundry bags that feel heavy duty and secure.I don't trust anyone with my nice items, so I basically only use Cleanly for when I run out of time and have a ton of basics (tshirts, socks, underwear), towels, or sheets. They have a good app and it's easy to schedule. The valet service comes on time within the window appointed. As such, they are the best at home laundry delivery service I've used.  If you have nicer items, maybe take a look at the other reviews here. I generally only wash my favorite items by myself. Unfortunately, I'm just not sure what alternatives there are."
4.0,0.2276,"Cleanly saves my life week after week! I hadn't seen the best reviews so I was hesitate---but I am so glad I tried it anyway. Doing laundry is impossible when you're a single, busy professional in NYC. I don't have laundry in my building, nor do I have the time to go sit at a laundromat for hours. To be honest, I don't even have time to simply take my laundry to drop it off. I love Cleanly because it is SO EASY to place an order for pick up and drop off service on the app. You can even get same-day. I give them almost 2-3 LARGE bags at a time and the guys pick it up and drop it off like champs! They bring it back perfectly folded or hanging and I've  never had an issue. LOVE this service---and that says a lot for New York."
3.0,0.3063,"I initially loved Cleanly, so much so that I invested in a reserve membership.  However, since I have been in central Brooklyn​ (even with the reserve membership), I have been notified via text on 3/4 orders that my order would be at least an hour late.  Cleanly provides a link to reschedule ""for free"" if your order is late, however rescheduling is not really free because (1) to get your laundry back at the originally scheduled time you'll have to pay extra if your order was originally a free, three-day turn around and (2) the link to reschedule sometimes is defective and doesn't provide rescheduling times. These issues would be fine IF there were a customer service staff to assist customers from the back end while the app continues to develop and de-bug. Unfortunately, this is possibly the worst aspect of Cleanly--I have attempted to call the company three times and always get placed on hold, disconnected, and then never called back.  I've tried waiting on hold and asking for a return call--neither yields a human on the phone.The unavailability of customer service is particularly troubling when it is 9:30 p.m. and you receive a notification that your pickup will be at least an hour late but you can ""reschedule for free,"" yet the text link only allows you to reschedule for a rush delivery fee. You'll get your laundry eventually, but plan for about a two day flex range unless you're ready to wait on pick-up or drop-off all night."
1.0,0.3388,"I used Cleanly many times with no issues from the time I first signed up until several months ago. I used to think it was a great service. However, in or around March of this year (2018) something changed and everything went downhill. I don't know whether there was a management change or whether the company is just incompetent but I recommend that you never use them. They will lose your expensive clothing, act like it's no big deal, and make you wait weeks for an answer. They also claim that customer service is available but they do not pick up the phone and it takes days to get a response to an e-mail. AVOID THIS COMPANY. SERIOUSLY!The first incident occurred in March of 2018. I sent out a very large wash and fold order and everything in the order could be machine washed. However, Cleanly unilaterally decided, without 1st consulting me, that some of the items needed to be dry-cleaned (they did not) and removed them from the wash and fold. Thereafter, all of these items (two pairs of pants and 10+ button-down shirts) went missing. I contacted the company and they were extremely slow to respond. It took multiple e-mails and phone calls and nobody would tell me what was going on other to say they were ""working on it."" Eventually, after two weeks of going back and forth, they finally located my items, but even then a pair of pants was still missing. While they eventually reimbursed me for this item, it was not before they accused me of being a liar and not sending the pants out in the first instance. They also refused to credit my account for all the hassles, merely offering me a 20% off discount on my next order. Thereafter, when I went I informed them I was deleting my account and that they should not charge me for the order, the begged me to give them a 2nd shot and told me to use the 20% off coupon and they would take special care to ensure this type of thing did not happen again and to properly inventory my clothing.Despite my better judgment (which I honestly should have followed), in April of 2018 I decided to give them one more chance. However, since I did not trust them for wash and fold, I decided I would send out my dry-cleaning to them (I had never previously had an issue with the dry-cleaning service). My dry-cleaning was picked up (4 items, two suit jackets and two suit paints i.e. two full suits) and the next day I received an invoice for only 3 items (2 jackets and 1 pair of pants). I immediately contacted the company. First, I received incorrect information from them. Then, when I called back they told me the item couldn't be deemed ""missing"" until after my other items were delivered and to call back when they were. They also said they would update me by e-mail but never did and tried to play it off as an ""invoicing error"" when in fact it was not. When the clothing was finally delivered, only 3 items were returned, but the hanger that the 4th item was on was IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DRY CLEANING BAG. As soon as I got the delivery, I asked the delivery guy what was going on. He shrugged and said he had no clue he was just the delivery person. I then attempted to call the company multiple times but nobody answers the phone causing me to wait on hold 3 times for over 30 minutes only to ultimately not be able to reach anyone. I also sent 2 emails and a Facebook message that as of now have gone unanswered. The pants that are missing were custom made and everyone at Cleanly continues to act like this is no big deal. In addition, they again accused me of not putting the pants into the bag as if they were trying to imply I was a liar. When all of this is said and done, I will be deleting my account permanently and never using Cleanly again. I recommend that you do not start using Cleanly if you are thinking about doing so and that you delete your account if you already have one, before something like this happens to you."

Their valets are really nice, and always come to the door with a smile. Since Cleanly's been around I haven't had to rush home before the laundry place closes, which makes all the difference because now I don't have to worry. I've always got all my items back, and they feel and smell great. I don't see myself going back to any other laundry service, which is a big statement.

The app is super easy and the prices in my opinion are cheaper than some of my laundromats around my place in EV.You have the options for washing preferences and everything has been clean and fresh! My only recommendation is if you do the hang dry option, make sure you're home to receive it ASAP and take it out to further dry. It gets delivered semi dry so if you don't air it out it'll get that mildewy smell which is NOT OK!Otherwise my experience has been great with Cleanly and prefer it over other laundry services"

So, I'd like to update my review to mention that I DO feel as though I can trust Cleanly to handle my wash & fold needs and I would recommend them for that.  They are consistently on time, if not slightly early and the convenience of not having to lug my clothes around & spend time at the Laundromat is beyond worth it for me-- using the app is SO easy.  My wash & fold comes back smelling nice & usually folded without wrinkles."

I would send in laundry for their overnight service (which costs more) and they would send an email at midnight saying it won't be ready until the following day and that they rescheduled the delivery time for a different inconvenient time. They only deliver in the morning and evening so they state it's not even possible for them to fix the delay and deliver during the day. Don't use this laundry service. Also forget about trying to get ahold of them by phone, no one answers."

The app was really easy to use, and you can specify where stains are/ where they need to pay special attention with a photo/ description. Pick up and delivery were easy to schedule, and I just left the items with my doorman for pickup. There are text messages that tell you where your items are, and customer service was great! I had to contact them about a billing issue and got a response within a day. Would recommend!"

The second last time I used their service they rescheduled my return time twice. fine, I am ok with that.The very last time I used it in mid June, the delivery guy just said that my hangdry shirts are delayed. I immediately looked it up and emailed customer service right the way to check the status. After their ""10 business days of extensive search"" they declared that they have lost my shirts. I am not asking for too much, only hoping that they can reimburse me the cost of the clothes (they are tailor-made shirts btw).not only they couldn't match the cost, they could only reimburse me 10 times of the cost of washing the items. just $90 bucks for three shirts. so like what? I shouldn't do laundry with them for any item that's more than 30 bucks? anyway gonna be the last time using their service. so long, cleanly."

Be aware: Cleanly ships everything to the Bronx. It is obvious that the cleaner doesn't know the difference between a $300 sweatshirt and a $30 sweatshirt and frankly, I bet they don't care. This lack of quality is reiterated in other Yelp reviews...just keep scrolling down.My order is unacceptable in its current form."

There is no discount or anything if they do this, you're supposed to just be at home whenever they're free I guess?Second problem: I signed up because of a promo code for $10 off the first three orders. This discount was not applied to my order. Third problem: I messaged customer support about the issue with the invoice for my order. After sending a screenshot of the discount still showing in my Cleanly app, they stopped responding. It's been two days.On top of all of this, they charge extra for items you can just throw in other places (like duvets).Absolutely will not use again, and regret using it once."

I once had a delivery guy cancel and I got a notification that I cancelled my order, so I was charged. When I reached out to customer service they were extremely helpful and reversed the fee. They responded in a timely manner, and I was able to create another order. To be honest, it is pretty pricey to use. I usually wait until they have a promotion so I can use them."

5.0,0.3836,"I used Cleanly one time, my first time using a laundry service, and I will never be using one again. My clothes are predominantly black and white, making them exceptionally easy to sort. And yet, when I received my clothes back from Cleanly all of my whites were a dingy grey!!! I was absolutely floored that a professional laundry service would return my clothes in such a state. It was not a minor change in color, either: the clothes were completely unwearable. Not only that, but one of my air-dried white shirts that wasn't dirty at all when I gave it to them came back filthy, splashed and splattered with dirty water. (It was extremely humid and rainy on the day they returned them and the plastic over the clothes was ripped and scrunched around the top of the hanger.)Speaking of hang-dry items, take caution. They use wire hangers to do it, meaning you get shirts back completely misshapen and stretched out at the shoulders. Those were also unwearable.When I told Cleanly about these issues, they were nice and responsive, but insisted that let them try to fix the shirts before reimbursing me. That was obviously going to be a waste of time, and it was. Those clothes came back in the same condition (including the shirt they got dirty...still dirty). The blacks they were redoing due to the misshapenness came back with white detergent all over them, so were again unwearable. The smell of detergent on everything was actually overpowering.I was reimbursed for the shirts, but only up to 10x the cost of washing the specific clothes that were ruined. That was about $75 total for 6-7 shirts. Clearly not sufficient to replace what was ruined. They also only reimbursed for the order cost of the shirts they ruined, not the entire order.Based on other reviews, I think I just had horrible luck. Customer service was very responsive and as helpful as they could be within their policies."

They make you submit a picture that the tag says to wash separately- which it did- but either way that shouldn't matter as this is already described in the service. When I asked for reimbursement they ignored and asked if they could try to re-wash it. You select a time slot for pick ups and drop offs- they are rarely on time. I've had them show up 40 minutes early OR over an hour late. Whats the point of schedules when I cant plan around it? This week:Monday- Pick up cancelledTuesday- Late Pick upWednesday- 1.5 hour late drop off, they tell you that you can reschedule and wont be charged the rescheduling fee- I got charged anywayWednesday evening- Rescheduled drop off is cancelledI asked for a refund and I got $10 off of a $70 dollar order. I will NEVER be using this service again- my boyfriend and i have been loyal customers. Take accountability and research the meaning behind good customer service. Oh and did I mention I was just on hold for 45 minutes just for their automated voice to say ""sorry we cant help you right now call back later?"""

3.0,0.361,"I want to like Cleanly, but they just won't let me. It seems like every time I open the app, there are no pickup times available until the next day. OK, not the end of the world, but as a business traveler, I sometimes just need my clothes cleaned that day. So I finally planned ahead enough one week to schedule a Cleanly pickup the next evening. There's a 3% discount for leaving laundry with your doorman, and since I was in a hotel, that was going to be easy. The app told me my pickup would happen before 7pm, but then I got a text saying it would be between 7-10pm (weird). I left my laundry with the front desk the next morning, with clear instructions in the app to pickup from there.Fast forward to the next night. It's 10:30pm, and I'm out when I get a text that just says ""the gentleman at the front desk refuse to look for your clothes"". I replied asking if this was Cleanly, but got no response. Annoyed, I head back to my hotel to talk to the front desk. Turns out the pickup guy said that he was picking up clothes from my room. The front desk called my room twice (but of course I wasn't there). They then suggested the pickup guy call me, to which he responded to them ""I'll just mark is as a no show."" Of course since it was a different person at the front desk, they didn't know my clothes were just sitting in the luggage room.This will probably be my last attempt at using Cleanly. Their support section in the app also just gives a general ""network error"" when you click it too, thus the airing of grievances on Yelp. Rinse (a similar service in SF) has worked seamlessly for me, so Cleanly has just been a huge failure.C an't seem to get their scheduling right.L ack of communication from the pickup guy.E rror messages in the app.A nnoying overall experience.N ever seem to have earlier pickup windows.L ocal laundry places are more effective.Y ou're better off just hiring a courier or TaskRabbit."

1.0,0.2577,"If you're considering signing up for Cleanly, this is an important story for you to read. I have used Cleanly consistently for a couple years - for both dry cleaned clothing and laundered shirts. Initially, I was thrilled with the service. Good quality cleaning, and responsive support staff. But something has gone seriously wrong over the past few months.The cleaning service has gone substantially downhill, with clothes beginning to come back feeling less ""fresh"", more frequently damaged, and often not even properly pressed. Making matters dramatically worse, I sent in a big bunch of clothing a couple weeks ago - an almost $300 order. And Cleanly managed to lose a substantial portion of it. I reached out immediately, and have received a bunch of not-so-apologetic form letters in return, apologizing for the ""inconvenience"". They claim to be searching for the items, but days go by without any updates. I even emailed the chief executive, who couldn't be bothered to respond.Losing a loyal customer's clothing is bad enough, but the cavalier response shows a complete lack of care for customers' belongings. I note that another user just days ago reported he same issue. Caveat emptor."

The deliver people are always nice and usually show up within 5-10 minutes of the beginning of the window you selected for delivery.Having the option to select warm / cold + dry temperature is really nice - I haven't had any clothes come back damaged. There have been two occasions were my items weren't perfect - once I received clothes that felt slick, I believe that they may have used softener even though I selected to not have it applied, and another time my clothes were folded but had a lot of wrinkles - both things I could live with - otherwise every other time has met my expectations.The only thing missing from the service is an Android application, it's a little annoying to have to use the mobile site to manage an order and I haven't been able to 'track' my delivery person via Android yet.Overall I would recommend Cleanly to anyone who is wanting a convenient service to have their clothes cleaned and is willing to pay a little extra for that luxury."

My potholder was bleached and ruined. 2.  My towels were bleached and ruined. 3. Some items were sent back inside out. 4. Every shirt was folded backwards most and very wrinkled as well. 5. A silk blouse was folded carelessly and is wrinkled terribly. 6. My makeup case was balled up instead of folded. 7. My hangdry items were returned in a plastic bag on hangers but were put inside haphazardly and completely wrinkled, defeats the purpose of hang dry. 8.  24 hours after receiving my order, EVERYTHING IN MY HANG DRY IS STILL WET and now smells of mildew. 9.

This has happened three times but it probably happens when they take it upstairs, because it's always in the same spot. I told Cleanly about it once and they offered to rewash the clothes.-Personally, I find the price to wash bigger blankets and larger items to be too steep.Overall I like the service.

The first time it took DAYS to hear even a peep from cleanly as to where my personal property was after they missed their delivery window. After being talked down by the manager, Torva, who assured me she would personally be keeping an eye on my orders going forward, I decided to keep using Cleanly.Flash forward a couple months to my current order, scheduled to be picked up Friday AM, dropped off Sunday PM. Pick up goes off without a hitch, then Sunday night I get a text saying something happened with my valet and they are unable to deliver my order - it will be rescheduled for the next available time.

2.0,0.3644,"This service is absolutely terrible. It was my first time using this app and on Friday I was trying to schedule a pickup for my laundry on Sunday night. Seeing that I was very unfamiliar app I had included a lot of errors in my pickup order including what kind of services I wanted and how I wanted them to be done. As a result I had to cancel that order immediately and proceeded to create another order. What I didn't realize was that even though I had cancelled my order almost immediately after I had created it, I would be charged for doing so. I came to realize this a few days later. Second of all, I had scheduled for my laundry to be picked up on a Sunday night and I purposely stayed in my room during the time selected to wait for the service to come and pick up my clothes. However, when the time had come no attempt to reach out to me had been made, but when I decided to check my app order had been automatically cancelled and a 5 dollar cancellation fee had been charged to my card. Seeing all the other bad reviews on here I can only assume this is the only way they have been making money lately, false cancellation charges, without any efforts of communication. I will definitely not be using this service again and it sucks because it creates a lot of doubt for other services similar to this that might not be as shady. I also reached out to customer service for a refund on these fraudulent charges, but they have still yet to answer/reply to any of my calls/emails."

AVOID CLEANLY AT ALL COSTS.Our experience with Cleanly has been a completely Kafkaesque nightmare.We gave them a bag of laundry (containing almost all of my girlfriend's clothes) and a good amount of dry cleaning. We were excited to try the service, hoping that it would save us the inconvenience of walking our laundry down the block to do ourselves.Cleanly lost ALL the laundry we gave them, and returned the dry cleaning with severely damaged or lost items. The suit I gave them came back with a 1+ inch hole in the arm. How could that even happen? My girlfriend's Marc Jacobs ski jacket had the fur lining completely lost.We then repeatedly called Cleanly's customer service line, without any answer for days. When we finally started receiving responses to our emails (still no calls), the responses made it feel like losing all of a customer's items was completely routine for them. They refused to tell us anything about whether we would be refunded for the service or reimbursed for our lost and damaged items. They also refused to tell us anything they had done to try and find our clothes, despite multiple emails asking.Finally, longer than TWO WEEKS later, and after HOURS of wasted time, we received a response that actually addressed our issues in any way. Our laundry had been found (supposedly), but the fur lining was still lost and they would not reimburse me for the full value of the suit they destroyed.When I stated that I wanted the full value of the suit, or would look at legal avenues, they threatened to cut off all communication (implicitly threatening that they would hold our lost laundry they still have as a ransom).Quixotically hoping that we receive our clothes back and get reimbursed for the inexplicable damage Cleanly caused to my suit. Cleanly has been a complete and total nightmare. Instead of cleaning our clothes conveniently it was lost and damaged. Avoid Cleanly at all costs. Our experience was NOT an isolated incident. Look at all the similar reviews. Avoid. Run. Cleanly is spiraling downward into the abyss. A complete sh*t show."
2.0,0.2596,"I was nervous to use the service for my first time, but from the valet doing the pickup to having to call after my order was delivered, everyone was extremely helpful! I was nervous about including towels in my order, so the valet had me put them separate so they got washed separately. When I got my order after work, my hang dry items were MIA. I called Cleanly, and they resolved my issue within 15 minutes (turns out I had the items all along, they were just hanging in the buildings closet). I'll absolutely use them again.My only complaint is that I wish they had more details on their website for first time users, but if you get a helpful valet, they'll be able to answer any questions at your initial pickup."

I just received my dropped off clothing, but only received my 6 dry-cleaned items and someone else's bag of wash-and-fold laundry. Cleanly does not have a clear process in place to return my shirts to me, so I may be out of 10 shirts."
1.0,0.2625,"First time writing a review because I had such a bad experience with cleanly. 1st - they overcharged me slightly, not a big deal. The pick and drop off was fast and things looked clean once I pulled them out of the bag. 2nd - I immediately took my folded clothing on a work trip without looking through it all, got to my first stop and found a pair of someone else underwear... not great but I would have probably overlooked except 3rd - One of my favorite shirts (pale pink) has dark blue stains all over it, after going back and forth with cleanly over email they offered me $15 in cash ($28 shirt, I sent them the link) or $18 or so in credit, I don't want credit for somewhere I'm never going to use again! To summarise: Ruined my clothing and refused to pay for it (I provided photos), would not use and recommend you do not either."
5.0,0.2452,"Overall: 3/5If you don't have coin laundry nearby it could be your only reasonable option.Otherwise I'd use coin laundry if in building.Availability: 3/5+ stars for being able to schedule somewhat last minute (like 8-9pm pickup window at 7:30pm)- stars for having limited scheduling (really early mornings or 7pm-10pm only)... having a 5:30-6:30pm slot would be great so I can get delivery and then still go out for a night of fun.Cost: 2/5Compared to coin laundry, it's definitely expensive at $1.50/lbs. To top it off, certain things cost more even if I normally wash with my other clothes. Like blankets for $16I have very thin sheets/covers that I wash like normal, but I'm worried Cleanly will charge me for them so I have to wash them elsewhere.For catered service I suppose $1.50/lbs isn't bad for small loads but the extra charges definitely put me off. There should be an option to wash all as by the pound.I'm not sure how reliable the weighting system is tho... seems a bit fishy sometimes.Service: 4/5The delivery people seem nice. Support seems okay with simple questions.Quality: 3/5They fold your items but in the case of socks they stretch them out like crazy to bundle socks inside out... this KILLS my socks and I've thrown away several pairs due to this.Otherwise the washes seem fine. I'd appreciate if they could add some oxyclean to clear out sweat stains from my whites tho."

5.0,0.3681,"Massive disappointment. I was a very happy dry cleaning customer with The Dhobi who got bought by Cleanly and, after using them twice, I can say they are nothing like The Dhobi and I will never use them again.My biggest dislike of Cleanly is they refuse to return my items without plastic. Really? It's 2017. Being environmentally conscious is ""in"". Every customer has their own bag so putting everything in plastic and then in the bag is silly.Second, the Cleanly pickup/drop off bags are so cheap and impractical compared to The Dhobi, who used the Green Garmento (from shark tank). This bag converted from a laundry bag when items were dirty into a garment bag when they were clean. The Cleanly bag is *only* a garment bag so it's really awkward to fill and load with dirty items.Lastly, they refused to dry clean one of my items. It's a jacket where the snap ripped through the fabric on one pocket. It's been there for years and other companies have dry cleaned it no problem. They didn't give me an option to clean it. Just said no and returned it dirty with my order.I'm giving two stars because the delivery guys are very friendly and on time."

And my hang-dry polos were so wet and stinky that I wasn't able to use them without washing them again.  When the dry-clean came back, 1 day late,  surprise number 2: 3 shirts missing.I'm not sure what is going on, but i'm perplexed to read the same story from other customers. And of course, after contacting Cleanly, like everybody else, i got nothing back but a templatized message  saying that they are searching for my shirts. Oh, they also make sure to include a link to their usage terms, where they tell you that the max reimbursement for a shirt is aprox. $45 (which of course, doesn't cover even half of the cost to replace the shirts).I wish I've read these reviews before trying it in the first place. From now on, i'll make sure walk a few blocks and drop my clothes at a local laundry. At least i'm positive that i won't miss 3 shirts in the process."
3.0,0.2554,"I received a text 10 minutes before my delivery window was over they were running behind and had ""automatically rescheduled"" by delivery for 5 days later. I tried to reschedule next day on the app, but there were no available days. No one from customer service online ever got back to me. After waiting on hold for an hour I was finally connected to someone on the phone. I explained I was traveling for work the next day and needed my items ASAP. The delivery was rescheduled for the next day, but I received notifications the delivery would be up to 30 minutes late after the delivery window. This was a problem because I needed to get to work. I waited on hold for 30 minutes to try to talk to someone to find the status of my delivery. When I finally received my laundry all of my clothes had a mildew smell to them. It is the smell clothes obtain when they are left in the washer wet for hours or a day before being put in the dryer. I had to take the clothes with me and wash in the hotel. When I contacted cleanly asking for a refund because I had to rewash all my clothes, I finally received a notification 10 days later, I fell after the ""7 day window"" and was not eligible for a refund. There is no number to contact where you get immediate customer service or a real time reply on your your inquiries or problems. It is extremely frustrating when a company keeps 30lbs of your  clothes hostage, and does not have anyone you can speak to right away. The worst customer service I ever received. Cleanly is not worth the cost or the hassle. Drop your clothes off at a local wash and fold for half the price and they will deliver back to you for free."

If you have never use them before please heed my warning!!!I first heard about cleanly from Timout top ten NYC wash and fold services.How it made it there is astonishing to me. Everything started out well but quickly turned for the worse. All of my lace under garments that barely been worn came back to me riddled with holes i mean completely destroyed, I have no idea how that could have even happened. My whites that were supposed to be bleached were dingy as if they were washed with colors also there were men's clothing that didn't belong to me mixed with my things which means someone's things were misplaced and it's a good possibility mine have been misplaced as well and to top it off instead of my things arriving at 10 am the following day it arrived at 730pm right when I had plans. This was truly a horrible service I've lost hundreds of dollars of lingerie this is the first and last time I ever use cleanly and definitely will not recommend anyone to use this company in fact I'll be warning people to steer clear."
2.0,0.3118,"UPDATE: September 30 2018 - Yesterday I got THE FIRST response from customer service. It took over 15 emails and 20 phone messages left ( their voice mail says you will get a call back in two hours - this took almost 6 weeks). I finally after 6 weeks got them to credit me back for the charge for cleaning my laundry that I NEVER GOT BACK. They admit to delivering it to the wrong building, but say that the doorman of that building has told them I PICKED IT UP!!  I was not even told until last week what building they delivered it to!!  SInce they are saying I picked it up ( which I did not) , they are refusing to reimburse me for anything.I have filled out the small claims court forms and will be there on Monday. If anyone wants to join me on a group claim I am happy to include you.This is without doubt the worst company and the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Here are a few things to do ( for those who agree with me):1. be sure to file a complaint with the better business bureau. (bbb.org/consumer-complai…)2. The President of the company is Tom Harari -- his twitter handle is @tomharari   Use it to make comments on Twitter. Write him a letter.3. Look on LinkedIn for people who work at Cleanly and send them messages about your issue. Barrage them with this info.4. Tweet about your experience. Send a direct message on twitter to or about Cleanly ( @cleanly)5. Continue to update your experiences on Yelp6. Comment of Facebook ( although I think they remove all the negative comments).Good comments  on this company are the exception, not the rule.  I would give them zero starts but they will not let you post a comment without at least one. Please BEWARE when using this company."
3.0,0.2949,"I was using them once a month or so and was happy with their delivery window options, ease of app use, and service in general (even though the cost is a fair amount more than other wash and fold services and there were a few delivery hiccups). This time - they changed my delivery time by 24 hours due to snow...okay but nothing else closed and it was a day later. Then after waiting around for my clothes, I check the app to try to find a contact number and they had changed the delivery to midday on Saturday! (Originally Thursday at 6:30 am, then Friday, then Saturday midday) With no notification, email, or way to contact them!!  So frustrating, and now I'll be running around to buy socks and underwear before going out of town for the weekend...?

The issues I have now is that they often show up 20-30 mins late behind their 1 hour window. And it took them longer to finish the laundry. As a result, they send my laundry back 1-2 day later than the schedule day like every the other week. And I always do my laundry during weekends this always cause problems as I won't have clothing for work or workout."

5.0,0.2305,"Seriously THE WORST.  This app/service deserves a special place in the devil's basement.  I rarely write reviews but when I do, it's well deserved.  Most of the terrible things are summed up in other reviews but I'll give a brief summary of my experiences:1: They have never once been on time for a pick-up, drop off.  I understand NYC has traffic, but you have an HOUR window, I have had drivers 3+ hours late.  They allow you to reschedule but only in their preselected time slots which are normally days later; they also don't give you the option to cancel.  The sad part is, if you start a new order there are literally 10+ time slots to choose from; so they will take on new customers but not take care of the orders they already have.2: Customer service is a JOKE.  I have waited weeks for responses.  90% of the time if/when they respond they don't have a clue what they are talking about or don't resolve your issue.  I haven't tried calling but I've heard this is a special kind of experience. 3: The final straw, when they ruined/lost four brand new shirts from Bloomingdales.  Originally they were returned to me with red stains all over them.  I allowed them to take the shirts back to try and remove the stains.  Over a month later and many email communications, I was informed that they could not locate my shirts and they were refunding my money based on the weight.  They gave me about $40 for shirts that cost me over $130.  I even had pictures of each shirt (from when they were returned with stains) along with purchase receipts.  Then to add insult, they offered me laundry credit.  NO WAY will I ever use your service again, even if it's free.Do yourself a favor and skip this service, I GUARANTEE you will be dissapointed."
1.0,0.2642,"Nope nope nope. We have been using Cleanly for dry cleaning for a few months, and in that time, they have often missed our delivery by a day or two beyond our scheduled time. Last night, they straight up lost two of my husband's dress shirts, one of which was custom-made. We still don't have them back, nor do we have any answers about what happened.They are impossible to get a hold of if you need to tell them about a problem or ask a question, and when they occasionally do answer the phone, it's an uninformed idiot who doesn't know anything.The delivery people sometimes show up in pairs like they're on their way out for the night, wearing no identification or uniform. Every time we hand them our clothes, my husband wonders if we're getting them back. Don't use this service.*********************************UPDATE: My husband just discovered three more shirts from a PREVIOUS order are also missing. This is now a pattern, not a mistake. And interestingly, the only missing shirts are the patterned, fashionable ones - we haven't lost any plain white shirts. Just the expensive, custom-made shirts that would be hard to find in a store."
3.0,0.2979,"I want to write a nasty review, but they did resolve my issue... (even though it was quite the hassle for me.) They lost my bath towels... no biggie. I figured I would just email them and let them know, and they would just make a separate trip to drop them off once they were aware they lost them.Wrong.They require 7 days to find (why not just go back to where the order was filled and look there?) lost items. I had put everyone of my bath towels in there, meaning I had nothing to dry myself with after a shower. I know it's not the end of the world, but still a pretty big annoyance and something I didn't expect to happen when sending them all my laundry. On the 8th day of them looking for my towels, they finally found them. They said they'd be delivered between 7 and 8. I pushed back the time of an obligation I had to stay home and wait. But, they never came and I had to leave at 8, so I left. I was only five minutes down the street when they called and said they were there (15 mins late). I apologized and said I HAD to be somewhere and since they were late, I left - but I can be back at my door in five minutes. The delivery guy gave me the biggest attitude as if he couldn't wait just five minutes (when HE was late.) To avoid losing my towels AGAIN, I sprinted back to my apartment and met him. He shoved the towels and me and walked away. So rude. I didn't necessarily mind they were late, it ended up working out fine, but his attitude soured an already frustrating situation. Not only did Cleanly lose my towels, it took them 8 days to find them, the delivery guy was late and then got mad at me for having to maintain my personal obligations instead of sitting inside waiting for a LATE delivery guy. My clothes (and late towels) did arrive clean, folded nicely, and smelling good. Cleanly customer service also responded in a timely manner and did solve my problem. (Although it just shouldn't have happened in the first place, or been resolved much quicker.) I'd recommend using this service at your own risk because if there are no hiccups in your order, the service is convenient and helpful."

5.0,0.2687,"Terrible experience. I had a washer and dryer in my NYC apartment for the past 4 years and recently moved into a spot without one. I didn't realize that I valued that washer and dryer more than space. Hence, after lugging laundry up and down 4 flights of stairs for a few months I decided there is probably an app for that.Cleanly came the first time and gave me some fancy bags. Then, they clocked in my order. They overcharged me for not one, but two comfortors at $25 a pop that were not in my laundry bag. WTF. After some emails with a fresh customer service person, they removed the charges. Then the laundry came back. A little dingy, and still with a faint smell of BO on my boyfriend's gym clothes.Why did I try again? I wish I didn't. Maybe I was giving them the benefit of the doubt out of sheer laziness. Even if they kinda sucked the first time.The second time around they really outdid themselves. They lost expensive clothes and linens. And those are just the ones we noticed. Who knew you should itemize and photograph your laundry that goes out. Hey guy packing the hang-dry bag, did you realize there were 5 items on the tag and only 4 in the bag? And that the 30-pound bag that was picked up was only like half as heavy as that when it was going back? That's weird, right? Are you wearing my jeans?They don't kinda suck, they royally suck. First impressions are usually on point. Don't use this service."
5.0,0.2425,My building doesn't have laundry and I finally got tired of having to schlep all my stuff to the laundry mat. I was nervous to try cleanly however I decided to give it a shot and I regret it. My first order with them was for sheets and towels and one of my sheets came back with a large tear and rip. These sheets have been washed for 9 months at the local laundromat and I've never had an issue. It's obvious that the laundry is being done quickly and a sloppy manner. I decided to give them one more chance with a second wash of my workout clothes. I just got them back and again there is damage. The metal piece at the end of the drawstring was ripped off. Whatever machines they are using and the methods are clearly very damaging to clothing. I've contacted support and I'm waiting for their response.

Well, not so. Now, you have to book days in advance with few time slots available. They valets are consistently extremely late and rushed. They are still very nice and very polite like always, but you just can't rely on the service anymore. I have a sneaking suspicion that the company changed the pay or hours or something for their valets and that a bunch of them quit. It's really too bad because I was sooooo happy with them before. But I can't be an hour late to work because I am waiting for someone to pick up my laundry!"

1.0,0.3673,"Have used their service for two years now, loved them at first, but in the last month, they have delivered late and worse of all lost two pieces of clothing in consecutive orders not picked up when they said they would. They are also refusing to compensate anywhere near what the items cost, despite losing two items in two consecutive orders. They clearly do not care about customer service or experience. I had to wait 10 business days to hear back from them to say it was lost. For the first item they offered cleanly credits and I was tempted to give them a second chance - what a terrible idea. They then lost my coat from my second order and will only compensate $140 for a $1200 coat... nowhere close to value and nothing was added to the base compensation rate as good will, given that this is the second item they lost. fool me once shame on them, fool me twice.. shame on me i guess.Additionally, the last item was clearly stolen as the hanger was in the bottom of the garment bag that they provided to deliver clothes back in and my building as already reviewed security footage to establish it wasn't taken inside the building by doormen. Looking at options to recover more of my losses. Would not recommend this service to anyone. Please beware."
1.0,0.3073,"My new building doesn't have a washer/dryer, so I decided to give Cleanly a try when I found a coupon code for $10 off. This was my first time using a laundry pick-up/delivery service. My boyfriend and I packed two large bags full of laundry. The Cleanly app was very easy to use, and the pick-up valet showed up on time. He didn't have the Cleanly bags advertised by the company, but I assumed that wasn't a big deal (this being my first time) and gave my laundry to him in trash bags. The next day, when my laundry was supposed to be delivered, I get a text saying there was a delay. No big deal - I rescheduled the delivery. When the second delivery time rolled around, I got a text saying my laundry was on the way and I could track the deliveryman on my phone. A few minutes after the little tracking dot reached my apartment, I got an e-mail from Cleanly saying I had missed my laundry pick-up but they would waive the fee since it was my first time. What?!? I refreshed my phone, and the tracking information for my delivery disappeared, saying tracking was no longer available. A few minutes after that, my laundry order completely disappeared from my Cleanly account on the app. I contacted Cleanly immediately after this, and they said there was nothing invoiced on my order and it appeared my laundry was missing. It's been nearly two weeks since the pick-up day, and I still haven't seen my laundry. Cleanly has apologized and said they're searching for my stuff. They also e-mailed once, asking if a picture (attached to the e-mail) showed my items. It did not. I'm extremely frustrated, as those two trash bags were stuffed full of laundry. I don't even know what all we lost. However, amongst the losses, we do know there was a duvet cover, sheets, a mattress cover, heaps of socks and underwear, my favorite blanket, my boyfriend's favorite jacket, several shirts, and more. At this point, I'm doubtful Cleanly will be able to find my laundry. They did say they will reimburse me if they can't find the items. Even if they do find them, I hope they don't dare charge me for the washing. After all this stress/frustration (not to mention needing to buy new socks/underwear because I gave Cleanly all of mine), I don't think I owe them anything. I'll update this review when Cleanly either returns my laundry or reimburses me for the loss.UPDATE: After three weeks, Cleanly found my laundry and returned it to me. The delivery wasn't flawless - the delivery person accidentally dropped it off in front of my neighbor's door but called immediately once she realized the mistake. I'm happy to report that Cleanly did not charge me for the order. If anyone's thinking of using Cleanly, I would highly advise that you do not give them anything of value to you."

I, for one, am a sucker for aesthetics. So I get it. I just tried Cleanly two days ago for the first time. I live out of only two suitcases so I was super concerned giving my clothes way. The kindest delivery person assured me they have a process in place for that. Yesterday, not only did I receive someone else's laundry, I didn't receive a single piece of my own. MY ENTIRE BAG OF LAUNDRY (which is about 90% of my entire wardrobe including ALL of my bedding) is GONE and because the ticket still says my name, I have some poor person's laundry bag instead, and there's nothing they can do. This is a mortifying experience. They do not have 24 customer service, it's all in email, and they refuse to call. Do yourself a favor and walk to the laundromat yourself. This is not now nor will ever be worth it. I have lost over $5,000 of clothing and it will likely be lost forever.

4.0,0.2375,"This is my third, and best review yet of Cleanly.  My first experience was bad, but with their customer service they offered to redo the order, so I was able to do so free of charge.  Still had a bad taste in my mouth though, so I hadn't used them since July 2015 until an email promo for 10% off this weekend, so I thought 'why not,' and sent off a giant bag of laundry.  I happily noticed the app has been updated.  I can now select scented (I like my laundry to smell like laundry), and they use Tide - which is impressive.  I also could select hot/cold water, bleach, and low heat - which is a huge deal because last time, my laundry came back burnt and excessively wrinkled.I'm in Chelsea, and they have gotten WAY BETTER.  Everything was folded properly, and I couldn't believe it, I opened the bag, and I smelled Tide - real, legit Tide detergent.  This is a HUGE plus for me, and I'm HOPING AND PRAYING that the service stays this good because I'd really like to remain a customer!  Thank you!!!"

1.0,0.1947,"I have a love-hate (maybe not hate, but definitley like-dislike) relationship with Cleanly. I have used them since they first came to Harlem and I never had any problems until this last year.For the most part I get my laundry picked up and dropped off several times a month and it is a seamless, hassle-free transaction. It is when I get back laundry and dry cleaning that is not mine, or when they misplace an item and ask if I have a picture to help them find it, or when an item or two come back with oil stains/completely ruined. All previous accounts of past orders, BUT I can give Cleanly a *chest bump* for always handing the situation and getting whatever it is wrong taken care of in a timely manner. Customer service is on point and always email me back wicked fast. I will say that I prefer Cleanly over other laundry services in the city. Their Reserve (premium membership) is worth every penny and would highly recommending joining. Despite any problems or ruined items (very few) they always make it right. End of review. Use Cleanly! *The feedback above is to be used as constructive criticism and not negative."
3.0,0.3504,"They've screwed up my laundry every time but once. They're always late with pick-ups and drop-offs, and they often cancel long after they're supposed to have arrived. Once, they texted old me to say they were cancelling because I hadn't answered the door. I got this text while sitting in front of the door, waiting for them to arrive. At this very moment, I haven't had clean clothes in a week due to their constant missing pickups (& rescheduling without asking you what time works). I was supposed to finally get them this morning, but a few minutes ago I got a surprise text telling me that I'd need to be home at 9pm to receive the order. Which is really great for me, because it means that i have to cancel plans with my friends, or else continue another day without clean clothes.Here's to hoping all my clothes are in the bag when it returns!"
1.0,0.2319,"The worst. Delivery was supposed come by 7, but instead came at 8:30 and they had lost all of our hang dry clothes. The refund policy is atrocious, about 10 dollars an item, which doesn't come close to covering most things.Save yourself the anxiety and money and never use Cleanly."
4.0,0.2959,"Cleanly has been a lifesaver since moving to NYC from Florida.  I wasn't used to apartments not having in-unit washers and dryers.  Without a car or the time to wait around at a laundromat for hours, I've basically tried to avoid doing laundry as much as possible. Enter Cleanly, which was recommended to me by my roommate. The app is so easy to use and I love that I can customize the way my laundry is done.  In around 24 hours, I can have a month's worth of laundry cleaned, folded, and hung to dry at a super reasonable price, all without leaving the comfort of my third floor apartment. Thank you, Cleanly, for making my transition to the city infinitely easier to handle."
0.0,0.2026,"I just left a review on Google but want to do one anywhere I can due to how awful this service is. They were fine in the beginning but have since ruined clothes, forgotten items, and cancelled deliveries without an explanation. I have worked in customer service, and theirs is a joke. I called twice, and both times waited for 20 minutes before the phone cut me off, emailed 3 times and never got a response, and only was answered when I sent a text. They are also CHEAP on their refunds and never seem sorry when they screw up your order. Most recently, they forgot to deliver 7 hang dry items (over $500 value of clothes) and they couldn't even respond to me. The whole point of having someone deliver your laundry is to be more convenient, but they are always late and the peace of mind that all your clothes will return is not worth the cost. I would save your time and money and use another service or go to a Laundromat. I cannot say enough bad things about this service, and I would give them 0 stars if I could. I will never use again!"
1.0,0.1938,"Though it is nice to have someone else do you laundry, the business just isn't capable of executing well. First, and most importantly, they lost my husbands dry cleaning. It was expensive work clothes. I just don't really know how they lose laundry? BUT, they did provide a reasonable reimbursement offer that I was satisfied with. Secondly, they never have dates/times available that are reasonable and the delivery dates get changed on you last minute or the pickup/delivery is late. Just solidly annoyed by this company as a whole. I wouldn't say I would never use them again but I won't send them anything important or that I wouldn't be willing to part with."

Also, ability to track the pick-up/delivery via gps is amazing and very much a need in 2017 here."
2.0,0.2848,"This is absolutely the worst laundry service provider. I'm a fool for using them more than once - naively thinking their first blunder was an innocent mistake, an outlier. I was wrong. They treated me horribly but I kept going back because there was no laundromat conveniently located to my apartment. I kept hoping, praying: maybe this time will be different. Maybe, just maybe my laundry will be done with care and delivered to me on time. I repeat: I was wrong. I learned the hard way. They will lose your laundry, ruin your clothes, ignore your detergent directions, deliver late, miscommunicate, treat you with disrespect, lie to you, ignore you, and then will also DELETE your negative comments on their Instagram. Pathetic, really. Despicable service. Despicable! #nevercleanly"
1.0,0.2584,"DO NOT USE - they lost my laundry! I never write Yelp reviews but felt compelled to write this one to help others avoid the horrible experience I have had with Cleanly.I used Cleanly 3-4 times, and then on my last use they LOST both my hang dry items which cost me ~$230. They only reimbursed me $50 for the lost clothes. Clearly this happens frequently so they cannot afford to reimburse people for what is actually lost. Terrible customer service, wish I'd read all the other reviews on lost clothes before I'd used the service. Back to the neighborhood laundromat for me."
1.0,0.3356,"Cleanly was great for the first year or so. Then, the day before Thanksgiving, they lost *every* *pair* of underwear I own (minus the pair I was wearing). They took quite a while to search for the missing lingerie bags, ultimately didn't find them, and reimbursed me a fraction of the cost of replacing my underwear collection. They say that the ""industry standard"" is to reimburse by the weight of the lost items. They weren't amenable to my argument that losing *every* *pair* of underwear someone owns is a qualitatively different mistake from losing a single garment--if in no other way than it puts an immediate financial burden on the customer to replace the underwear. They were perfectly pleasant to me on the phone, but they didn't--and, I suspect, won't--address the conditions that made this mistake possible in the first place. They are not bringing their operation to scale slowly and responsibly. They're outsourcing to too many different facilities, not managing their relationships with those facilities, and not creating the channels of communication necessary to hold them accountable for delivering the level of service customers expect. Which, of course, includes not losing *every* *pair* of underwear a customer owns. (It also includes following customers' directions re: scented detergent, hang drying, etc.).I take my laundry down the street now, which takes a few extra minutes every couple of weeks, but it's nice to look the person who's going to wash my clothes in the eye."

It's definitely super convenient, makes my life easier. The thing I love the most it's how the clothes smell soooooo clean and fresh, when I first did it myself in the corner laundry it would smell like burnt and I would hate it more than anything.

Don't recommend. flycleaners is also a bunch of criminals don't use them either."
1.0,0.3882,"Cleanly lost all my laundry on my first order with them.  Their response indicated this is not at all rare for them, and yet they seemed completely incapable of responding appropriately.  So, be warned - if they lose your whole wardrobe, they will not compensate you until they've lost the clothes for more than 3 weeks.  Even then, if they do compensate you, they'll calculate the cost of replacing your clothing not by the value of the clothes, but by calculating 10x the cost of washing each item - basically, this means if you have anything worth more than about $20, you're not likely to be able to replace it. I was excited to use Cleanly, but will forever warn everyone who will listen against it."

3.0,0.2898,"I was using cleanly reserve. This service schedules pick up times for you. When they arrived I gave them my laundry and a dry cleaning item in a bag with all of my information on it that they gave me for dry cleaning. They never identified it in my order and told me that it was because I never set up the pickup that way, but I didn't set the pickup at all because the app does it automatically which is another thing I hate. So they told me that now my laundry would all be delayed until Thursday and I needed to create a new order for the dry cleaning through the app. I told them okay I did please make sure no one shows up as you already have the item. Sure enough at 7am Tuesday someone shows up and I wasn't available so I got marked as a no show, which they did remove from my record but it was a complete waste of that guys time. Then they told me this would delay my entire order until Thursday. I said but I really need my clothes (the order was sent out Monday). They told me they would fix this but never did so I figured Thursday everything would show up. It did not, my dry cleaning still wasn't there. Then I get a message about a load of laundry they found that they can't identify and ask me to look through all of mine. I honestly don't remember everything in my laundry each week so I asked for a photo of the items to identify and never heard back. Friday I get a message about my delivery and I just tell them to leave it with the doorman as it's the evening when I have one. I got home late and was unable to check for the item. Now it's Saturday morning and at 7am (my phone is not on while I'm asleep) I get a call and text that my doorman isn't there (which is true because they aren't there in the morning) I never got a text from cleanly letting me know they were coming. Luckily I actually got my dry cleaning but overall I'm very unhappy with the service and have cancelled for the future."

5.0,0.23,I tried a few different places before going to cleanly and it is the best by far. They are always on time and the app is easy to use. It is a little pricey compared to other places but the service is worth it for sure. Clothes always smell great and are clean (which was an issue with other places). Another thing is that they have yet to shrink anything which was a huge issue with other places.

Could you replace all of your work clothes for $300? No. No you could not. Don't use this service."
4.0,0.2751,"I've used Cleanly three times now and it's definitely my favorite pick up/delivery laundry service in NYC. The app is sleek and easy to use, with many options to chose from in terms of laundry preference. I love that they have three separate bags to give you so you can choose to wash and fold, wash and hang dry or dry clean. So great, as I have MANY items that need to hang dry. I love the option to drop off with doorman, since I do live in a doorman building. Makes it convenient and easy for me. As for the actual laundry, my clothes have always returned clean and smelling great. They also do a great job with folding.I only have a few complaints. In the app, I find that I need to re-enter my address every time in order to denote that I want to drop off my laundry with my doorman, otherwise I'm forced to schedule a pick up and drop off time. I also noticed that I haven't been getting the promised doorman dropoff discount on my receipts which is a little frustrating. Finally, I've never had any clothing lost, but I have received a sock that wasn't mine. No big deal for me there though. And as always, you have to pay the price! It's expensive, but no more so than every other wash and fold service I have tried.I would also love the option to clean my whites with Clorox II instead of bleach, but that's being very picky. :)"

They sent me a bunch of emails and texts regarding the whole process and did the pick up on time and the delivery even earlier! The personnel were very nice and helpful. The clothes smell clean!

5.0,0.2274,"This review is long, but if you want to know if you should use Cleanly...the answer is unequivocally, unquestionably, YES. After moving to New York a year ago (from the deep south) I could never get a handle on the arduous, painful, and equally necessary task of laundry. I went to a self service laundromat about 3 blocks (avenue blocks, mind you) away, and I saw how their wash and fold service worked...it grossed me out. So, I did my own laundry, in New York, for a year. About a month ago I was done. I couldn't keep it up, so I searched Yelp and Google for an answer...behold, Cleanly. I was highly skeptical at first, having never used a wash and fold service, not to mention the idea of a stranger up to his or her elbows in my unmentionables. Well, I quickly got over that. They provide you with a giant (think 50 pound drum, okay kidding) canvas bag for wash and fold, a hanging bag for dry cleaning, and another hanging bag for hang dry items.Best things about Cleanly:1. The app makes it SO easy to order a pickup2. You get to pick wash temps, detergent type, dryer temp etc.3. You get to set the time, and in my experience (5 orders now) they arrive in the first 15 minutes of the 1 hour time window. Every. Single. Time.4. The valets I've dealt with are really friendly, which, I mean who doesn't like that?5. MY CLOTHES SMELL AMAZING.6. I haven't had any thing lost7. Cleanly Reserve. Worth it. This gets rid of the $30 minimum and $4.99 delivery fee (still worth it), and you get up to 12 hang dry pieces for free? I believe it's 12. Don't quote me.I have told all my friends about this service. It has literally changed my life. Cannot say enough good things."
3.0,0.2595,"This is a great idea with terrible performance.  Our orders were picked up or delivered on time only ONCE.  They only communicate by text and you can't ever get through to a real person.  They send bogus texts like the driver had an ""emergency"" and that the delivery can't be rescheduled for that same day however, once I took to twitter and made the response public I got an email 15 minutes later saying my order would be at my door that night.  We get our groceries delivered and never ever have any problems with them arriving on time, however Cleanly can't seem to make that happen.  Today they said there was a ""marathon in the area"" and traffic was at a standstill.  However, our groceries made it in the same delivery window and also we looked at Waze and traffic was fine.  Customer service is terrible and automated.  We've given them several chances to fix it (6 orders) and they haven't.  Won't be using again.UPDATE: They gave us someone else's laundry with ours!  And haven't responded to any of our messages letting them know we have it!  I feel terribly for the customer with missing clothes...ANOTHER UPDATE: We are missing some of our own laundry!  This has been a total nightmare.  They gave us a phone number to call for customer service and no one is picking up or calling back and no one is responding via email or text."
5.0,0.2754,"App and website are simple and easy, valets are on-time and professional, quality is always spot-on. Wash and fold and pressed shirts are a touch more expensive than your standard NYC laundromat ($1.50/lb for wash and fold and $3/shirt for pressing and hanging at time of writing this) but of course they actually come up to your apt door to pick it up and drop it off, which to me is worth the price.They're happy to your use existing laundry bags and when they return your pressed items they're all hung up nicely in a suit bag. They also let you specify preferences (both for a single order or your personal defaults) for things like water and dryer temp (which can be different for darks and lights!), detergent type, bleach or no bleach, etc., which is awesome. Getting back shrunken clothes from the laundromat is kind of a pet peeve of mine. Oh, and as far as I can tell they've never lost anything or accidentally put someone else's sock or t-shirt in my bag.Only small quibble is that pickup and delivery times are all in the morning before 10 or in the evening after about 5. I work from home so mid-day would be convenient. But I realize those windows are probably what work best for most people who actually leave their house for most of the day."

After 2 whole orders they have royally f*cked up again. I am currently sitting on hold trying to speak to a customer service representative because I was just charged a ""no show"" fee after I was sent a text that they were on their way to deliver my clothes. It is now 10 minutes past my delivery window, no one has delivered my clothes and they have charged me a ""no show"" fee thus accusing me of missing my window. I will never ever use Cleanly again. Try FlyCleaners- they have never lost my clothes and are typically pretty punctual. FlyCleaners is a bit more expensive but well worth the little bit of extra money when I'm not having to hunt down my clothes/Cleanly customer service over and over again."

They shrunk a priceless wool sweater (that had been purchased from the oldest wool mill in Ireland) despite the fact that I had put it in their dry cleaning pouch and specified that it should only be dry cleaned.I reached out to their customer service to request they attempt to fix the item and only after multiple emails from different reps they finally scheduled a pickup. I waited patiently for 4 days for them to fix the item, but when they delivered it back to me it had been shrunken even more!! The sweater can't even fit a small child, and it was originally a women's medium.To add insult to injury, when I reached back out to their customer service reps they informed me they could only give me a credit of $30 (the sweater was purchased for $220, which I had told them), and that there was nothing more they could do.STAY AWAY!"

I thought maybe I had stained the shirt and made the mistake of using Cleanly a third time. Then three two other shirts came back with stains on them and a pair of light gray pants that I bought a month earlier came back with dark spots all over them. Customer service got back to me within a day and offered to re-clean the items for free. We did that, but the clothes came back looking exactly the same. I reached out to customer service again and they offered me either Cleanly credit or cash per their damage policy (up to 10 x the weight of the items). I changed my review to two stars because they did reimburse me and were generally pretty responsive and pleasant. But the reimbursement didn't cover the original cost of the clothes, some of which were pretty new. And I wouldn't take the risk of using them again, unfortunately. But it was something at least."

As time went on, I began missing socks, underwear, shirts, etc.; to even getting other peoples clothing. As time went on, I went from losing or gaining clothing articles to losing an entire bag of cloths. The valet-delivery people are just as unprofessional and rude as the people are at the call center, when I made my claim.

There is always a time slot available, often same day, for pickup when I forget to schedule to have my laundry picked up. Getting the items sent back the next day is so helpful as well. Saves me the time of having to go to the laundrymat and sit around. It's so simple to have them pick it up and take care of the time consuming task for you! The laundry always comes back smelling great and folded. We ended up signing up for Cleanly Reserve to save the extra money on minimum fees and hang dry fees.

The pressed shirts come back impeccable but the most important thing is the folding. I'm convinced there are folding wizards tucked somewhere in a dank basement in Manhattan just going hard. The folding is a piece of art. They've folded round things into perfect squares and somehow everything, no matter what it is, is the exact same folded size as everything else.

What's worse than that - you then have to chase customer service for help. I sit forever on hold during the few hours they are actually ""open"" and never get through to a person. Their ""prompt"" email is not so prompt, and it takes days to get back the items you should have had returned to you in the first place.

I had a wash & fold order scheduled to be delivered on Wednesday, August 9 in the evening. It was dropped off on time, but when I went through it, they had not included ALL of my undergarments (bras, underwear, socks). Unfortunately, this is not like they misplaced a dress and I could just wear a different one. To make matters worse, I was on an 8am flight the next day and would be out of town for the next week. Once I emailed/called/stalked customer service, they were able to locate all of my items the next day, but because I was out of town, I had to purchase some new undergarments to last me the next week, which they refused to reimburse me for. Instead, they told me that they 'can wash my missing garments and deliver them for free'. It's not free if I've already paid for them and you're now just delivering them 7 days late. Finally, after I asked them, they reimburse me for the wash and fold that I paid for. I then schedule them to be delivered the next week on Thursday evening when I'm back in town.On the day that my lost items are supposed to be returned, they email me an hour and a half before delivery that 'due to needing more cleaning' my items will now be delivered the next day. More time? They've had them for over a week. I call customer service AGAIN to tell them that I this is unacceptable and I need my items delivered that night as originally scheduled. She tells me that my items can 'probably' be delivered tonight, but they won't be clean. When they finally get delivered at 11pm, they smell like mold. I'm pretty sure they washed them the week prior and then just left them sitting for days just damp, which doesn't give me confidence in their service. Throughout this entire process, they barley apologized and never offered any sort of make-good on their behalf. Such a disappointing and terrible customer experience. Use at your own risk."

NEW YORKWhen I had my assistant contract a cleaning company for my home in New York, Your company was selected for this very purpose: ""We built Cleanly to reflect our values of delightful service, simple design, and an obsession with quality. They drive everything we do""This morning my flight was cancelled from JFK to LA for the obvious reasons. Someone rang my doorbell and I answered it. Unbeknownst to me my laundry was arriving, I opened the door and one of you workers handed me my cleaned laundry in the frigid bleeding cold. I asked him WHO MADE YOU WORK IN THIS DANGEROUS WEATHER. He responded with not my employer but the need to keep the heat on in my house for my familyI respect this gentleman for his efforts in being dedicated to the company and his family and caring out the mission on both sides. I was not able to tip the gentleman because I had no cash. However, I was able to provide him a shovel and some salt to assist him with pushing his vehicle out of the snow where he was stuck. You have very dedicated staff!!! This weather is life threatening. I hope that you find a way to tip your workers for this dedicated sacrifice. It truly takes DEDICATED INDIVIUALS to put their life on the line for performing this type of job in this kind of weather where the Governor of the state declared a state of emergency. I hope this young man makes it back home safe to his family and I hope that this company thanks each and every soul that risked their life to work on today.Happy New YearRegards,Kendrick"
2.0,0.2907,"A great concept that seems to have hit a few operational wrinkles (ha!). I do not recommend using Cleanly. Like FlyCleaners, another service I initially loved, they started out strong. Expensive--but sweet app, tight delivery, premium quality bags, and hang dry service.  My last order, unfortunately, was a total misfire: - It came in 25 minutes after the delivery window, with no notification that he'd be late. Not the end of the world, but an inconvenient start to the day. - They included some nice lingerie that weren't mine, so I had to wait another 45 minutes for the guy to come back. - And clear signs of bleach damage to two (very nice) articles of clothing. I checked on here to see if this was an isolated incident and, nope, plenty of reviewers (especially more recent ones) have run into similar issues. These aren't starting-out kinks, these are quality control issues. This smells awfully like yet another startup tossing out customer experience in favor of scale. That sucks. The beautiful app, the cute ""valet"" concept, the subscription package... those are all nice... but without consistent delivery on the experience, it's all so much fluff. I'm just going to use my neighborhood place from now on."

Since I wasn't doing anything productive the entire day, I decided to e-mail the Cleanly team. After a few exchanges, they manually added my address for me.Someone came by to pick up my clothes within the first 15 minutes of my 1 hour window. I like when people are on time! She was super friendly and placed all my wash and fold laundry into a huge purple bag. She handed me two other bags for future use, one for hang dry clothing and one for dry cleaning.The following day, my driver came nearer the end of the 1 hour window. I took my clothes up to my apartment and opened the bag. Everything is neatly folded and best part is that they don't roll pairs of socks into each other! They lay them out flat, just the way they should be so they don't get ruined. Next time I think I'll request fragrance free Tide on the app since the scent is a bit strong.Overall, the service is excellent.

All went very well. Pleased with my recent service.*******I had nothing but positive experiences with cleanly for two years. I used them at least twice a month and was always satisfied with the service. Unfortunately, my entire bag of laundry that was sent out on August 24th and was supposed to be returned on August 26th was lost. It was only sheets and towels, which, though expensive and annoying to replace, is better than losing an entire bag of clothing. I understand that things happen and once in two years is a pretty good record. However, the circumstances were strange, as the laundry was marked delivered, the apartment number was printed on the tag and I was at home, and no one buzzed my apt. They did not call to say they were unable to get in. Follow up has been horrible, to say the least. I had to basically stalk customer service with calls and emails and it was 24 hours before I got someone on the phone. Every time I needed an update, I had to track it down (and explain again the entire situation to a new person). I was sent photos of laundry they thought was mine (um, how many missing things are there??) and none of it even vaguely resembled the detailed list I gave of my items, which makes me feel like this situation has not been taken seriously. In addition, the ""search process"" has taken over two weeks. How much area is there to search?I have been told that I will be contacted for reimbursement of the $450 worth of sheets, towels, and duvet covers that were lost. I have heard nothing.

They mentioned they needed 1 full week to search for it which I thought was pretty ridiculous. The second time I was guaranteed pick up from my hotel on a Fri evening and a return the following morning. Then I received a call late Fri evening after the pick up with some pointless queries to confirm my order which I thought was a waste of time as this was all confirmed online with my order which is pretty dummy proof. It was then confirmed that some of my laundry would  make it back Sat morning and the balance on Sat evening. Then on Sat evening I received another call only to be informed the balance  of laundry  would arrive Sun morning. And an email on Sunday afternoon stating it would not be finished till a few days later. Absolutely ridiculous especially given I made it clear right from the start my flight back overseas was Sunday evening and I would only put the order through if they could guarantee a return before my departure!..  Since I have returned back to my home country  I have tried to get in touch and emailed Cleanly several times trying to resolve my two issues above but received  no response whatsoever!.. This is contrary to the swift response I received from them when enquiring about a potential order. My observations of Cleanly:- I get a strong impression that they do not even do the laundry directly and are an outsource business who outsource to numerous providers whom they seem to have no control over leading to my issues above-  unprofessional - do not ever answer their hotline and it always goes to an answering machine. They  only return calls if it is at their convenience and suits them. -I question if they  have a professional office as it is probably run by one person from a home garage, with an outsourced call centre and a network of outsourced local Laundromats .Following my recent issues with Cleanly I am yet to receive any response from them after numerous attempts. My next course of action is reporting them to the local Police and Consumer Affairs.

If you get stuck at happy hour, you can change your drop off right then and there.- The customer service is excellent. I had a few things missing from an order once, and I was reimbursed within a week, and given a bonus credit for my next order.- The sheer range of pick up and drop off times makes Cleanly the perfect bet for people with less-than-standard work schedules.- Cleanly Reserve. The $85/year is more than worth it to not have to wait and meet the 30lb minimum for free delivery. Plus all the other perks.Some not-so-great things:- Your laundry will likely be washed by a different laundromat every time. This means you have to get used to some different folding styles, unfolded socks sometimes, and the higher likelihood of losing an article here and there.- Delivery windows can be wonky. As with any delivery service like this (Peapod, etc.) your delivery window depends on the delivery person. Sometimes they're late and sometimes they're early.

Turnaround time is better than what I get at any places locally, and they're priced about the same. But the real reason they get five stars is because they went above and beyond to save my dry cleaning after my well meaning boyfriend decided to toss all my silk blouses in with our wash & fold. Natasha was all over it and the Cleanly team went through all my laundry to pull out the dry clean only items!"
1.0,0.2683,"PLEASE AVOID USING THIS SERVICE! They lost my cashmere sweater and my pants that were on the pricier side (both of high value which makes me a bit suspicious). I emailed customer service 8-9 times (6 of the times following up for a response). I really think the customer service team consists of maybe 2 people or they're just not doing their jobs. I called and after 10 min, someone finally picked up. She said she once had a customer who lost an item and they found it a month and a half later so I might have to wait for it to be found. I was livid. How can a cleaning served be so bad at simply cleaning the pieces as instructed. They told me the reason my sweater is lost is because the material was cashmere, which is absolutely ridiculous. The price of the sweater was about $300 and they only reimbursed me 1/4 of it. I'm still waiting to hear back about my pants. If I could give Cleanly negative stars, I would. PLEASE avoid. It's for your benefit._UPDATE: they also lost my pants and tee - told me they can't reimburse me and asked me to make sure it's not at home. THESE GUYS ARE TERRIBLE."
5.0,0.2813,"Pretty good for the most part. Easy and seamless. There's no way to spend less than 25 dollars either because it weighs more or there's an 5 dollar charge if your laundry is under a certain weight. They also do nickel and dime you for charging you 5 dollars to air dry each or any additional item. Not sure why because there's really not much manual labor or service in leaving something out to dry. This certainly adds up if you own good jeans or clothes you don't want to shrink. They know this which is why it's an added cost. Regardless, I still use the app for the quickness, reliability, and seamlessness. It would be nice if they had a special instructions option for if you leave your jeans inside out, for them to be cleaned that way to preserve shape and color."
2.0,0.2275,"I've literally tried every single laundry place in my neighborhood. Every single one has disappointed. Either they don't pickup when they say they will,..or I have to hunt them and call repeatedly to get them to deliver,... or they don't give you back your laundry detergent. Cleanly for over a year now has always delivered and picked up on time. The one or two times they didn't,..they gave me a discount code for the next order and they texted me letting me know the delay. In addition, for my first order they delivered a laundry bag, weight it at my doorstep AND they gave me a little chocolate sampler. They only lose one star because they almost never adhere to my notes and preferences. Ever pickup I have to tell the delivery person to make sure the laundry people read my notes. Even then,..they don't do it all the time. Bar none this place is the best!"
0.0,0.2798,"I used to be a big fan of Cleanly. After trying a couple other laundry pick up/delivery services, I found Cleanly's service to be really good. That was until the last month or so during which they  stained several of my items, returned smelly clothes and then lost several hundred dollars worth of clothing. All this when I had paid extra for their ""Reserve"" membership. I suspect their quality has dropped due to expansion. When the reimbursement they offered was only a fraction of what the clothes they lost were worth, I asked them to cancel the annual Reserve membership. They told me that I was too far into the year to receive any sort of refund. I've only been a member since July...Reading another poster's review below, it also appears they offer higher reimbursements once folks post negative reviews online. They wrote to me, ""our goal is to make our reimbursement policy as fair as possible."" This hardly strikes me as fair."

I filled up the laundry bag with 66 articles and gave it to him. He asked for special care instructions and I said I already specified my preference online which is cold water and low heat for everything. He was about to leave without mentioning the scale and only told me it was broken until I asked him for an estimate.I scheduled for drop-off today. It came within the one-hour time window I specified. A different guy delivered it. I just counted, 66 items returned so nothing is missing. However, at least two of them seem to be bleached, one purple skirt (see picture) and one pair of sweatpants. The few light sports on the waistband of black sweatpants aren't too obvious, but the skirt is ruined :(I do like that Cleanly picks up and drops off laundry at my door and that I can schedule or reschedule the time. I also like that the clean laundry come back in an extra plastic bag inside the laundry bag, so they are kept clean. Not sure whether they wash the laundry bag, it will be even better if they do.Still my nice skirt is ruined..."

Out of the dozen times I've used them, the pickup person has only been later than my window of time maybe two times. The pickup and drop off times are convenient I find as someone who works 9-5 or later. My clothes always arrive smelling nice, if you choose scented detergent of course, and folded perfectly.

Nevertheless, the next day the clothes were delivered, perfectly fine, smelled wonderful and neatly folded...then I put in my second order. This time the clothes returned not smelling of anything and they literally had melted all of my panties. Panties that have been through the wash before, melted!

My only complaint however is the valet upon delivery just hanging around waiting for me to tip him. I thought there was no need to tip with Cleanly. Maybe I was wrong, but he sure did make the situation awkward especially when I carried my laundry up a five floor walk up and didn't ask him to do it."

1.0,0.3085,"Multiple time user here. The first few times the service were adequate, although on my most recent dry-cleaning order not only did they HANG my sweaters (one of which was a Missoni cardigan, which now has delightful hanger bumps,) but everything came back smelling of chemicals. I had to air out my coats and jackets before putting them in my closet. My most recent order for wash and fold was a nightmare. The order was picked up promptly in the morning and scheduled for same day delivery, but a few hours after sending out my order I received an email stating that my order would be delayed because they didn't know how to wash the stuff (which honestly was underwear and a bathmat, pretty straightforward.) I responded to them that I would accept the delay and told them when to next deliver it. Another few hours go by and I receive a text AND another email saying they still don't know what to do with my stuff, and that they were holding it until I decided (making it seem like the delay is my fault, right?) I send out ANOTHER email telling them I had already replied with instructions. Then I receive ANOTHER text telling me that they STILL don't know what to do. By this point there's no way my order will be done on time. I sent them a total of four emails before I called them (during their very limited phone hours) to explain the situation. To their credit, the woman who picked up was apologetic, but that didn't change the fact that their email system is broken and no one in their company cares enough to fix it. My email inbox is littered with Cleanly spam because every time I sent an email, I would receive an automatic response stating that their server wasn't accepting requests. I would then get another email a few days later saying the attempted email has failed permanently. SO, basically Cleanly can email you but you can't email them back. They will then hold your clothes until you can call them. Great system right?Okay so I finally receive my order and guess what? My white Matouk bathmat (which cost a hefty sum) is not only fraying, but a dingy grey with BLUE STAINS from unwashed detergent. The quality of the order was pathetically bad, given the fact that they had TWO EXTRA DAYS to fix it. In sum, not only was my order horribly delayed and Cleanly a pain in the neck to get a hold of, by the time I finally received it my items were stained and still damp, in even worse condition ""clean"" than they were dirty! I am currently trying to have them rewash my bathmat, and the same unresponsiveness has made this process take DAYS. My bathmat is still stained."
4.0,0.2057,"10/31/2017 update:Cleanly has really started to have some issues. I've been mistakenly overcharged multiple times. While it is usually easily resolved with customer service, the fact that I have to deal with customer service rather than having them do it right the first time is very frustrating. I'm definitely open to exploring new options and other services, especially after I've had clothes completely ruined by them. Sad it's gone down hill.Original Post:Having used many local laundromats for wash and fold, I've found that Cleanly has been my best experience to date! Pricing is available in the app up front, delivery is free if you have over 20 pounds of laundry, and the staff is always very nice.  I've been using cleanly for over a year now.The first time you book using the service, they bring you a laundry bag with a tag. The new laundry bags are very sturdy compared to the older ones, which is a huge plus. I don't see that ripping ever! You book 1 hour time slots in the app either in the morning or the evening, and Cleanly texts you when your valet is on the way! I love this feature coz then I'm not left guessing when the valet is going to show up. I've only had one instance where the valet was delayed, and the app sent a text letting me know that he'd be about 20 minutes late. The quality of the laundry is great - I've never gotten someone else's underwear or socks, never had anything shrunk. In my neighborhood, the cheaper wash and fold services always lose my socks and give me other people's stuff, and they don't deliver or pick up on time, so I'd rather pay a little more for a service that I can rely on.Can't recommend the service enough - I've had nothing but positive experiences from the very nice valets to the clean laundry!"
4.0,0.2267,"I sent the below email to Cleanly customer support one month ago. No one ever even responded, which is why ultimately this review is 1 star. ==========Hi Cleanly,I have been a customer for over a year.  For the first 6 months, I was thrilled with your service.  I always selected the options for unscented detergent and no fabric softener, and Cleanly complied. I have spent over $600 with you in the past year and recommended many friends.Then in December 2015, my order came back intensely scented with fabric softener (doesn't smell like Tide).  Your customer service was responsive and picked it up to rewash it.  But ever since, it has been very hit or miss.  Sometimes it's unscented, sometimes scented.  Sometimes half the wash is scented and half not.  Customer support is always apologetic, and they give me a $5 credit or whatever, but I have clothing in my closet that I'm reluctant to wear because it smells so sickly sweet, and for months (I guess the promises in the commercials are true).My most recent order was two blankets and some towels.  It was so heavily scented that I had to take it to a friend's apartment who has a balcony to air it out.  Before I even explained to the friend what I was doing there with my laundry, he said ""Ugh, that stuff stinks!"" I have asked customer service to look into why this happens--whether it was a new laundry facility you started using in December, a staff person not reading the instructions, or what.  But at this point, I just don't feel that I can rely on Cleanly anymore to follow my request--a simple request I'd think, since it's an option in your app.I will continue to recommend your service to people who don't care about scented laundry, but I will have to find another option for myself.  I'm still holding out hope that you will be able to sort this out and offer me some kind of explanation to give me confidence again, but for now, so long.Sincerely,Elizabeth"

The customer service agent that worked with me this time was Bella, and she was excellent--very polite and understanding throughout the entire process with plenty of communication via email. Unfortunately the hang dry items from the new order were missing, AGAIN. I promptly called Cleanly and this time, however, they were located within 15 minutes and delivered the same day.Bottomline, I'm unhappy that my items were lost/misplaced in the first place, but luckily they were able to locate them both times and the customer service was exceptional throughout."

There is a drop off laundry service on basically every block on NYC and this service doesn't stand out enough to charge the prices they do. My go to place washes things serperately with no issue . I was advised cleanly doesn't wash clothes separately so I ended up just having them was all the darks. When my clothes returned home there was a bleach stain on a pair of black workout pants I found this to be odd considering darks wouldn't be bleached and I sent no whites. Cost to service ratio I'd say skip cleanly. As there are thousands of was and fold places in this city and plenty that offer free delivery.

Cleanly does a great job not only with cleaning your clothes the way you want them to be cleaned but they notify you progress every step of the way. Love this communication!! Especially when they have some of your favorite belongings. I did have one instance where they left one of my bags at the Cleanly warehouse. Usually something like this could cause headache but the service was outstanding- they not only made it a priority to get the bag back to me in a timely manner but they put credit on my account as well as gave me promo discounts to encourage me to continue using the service. I haven't had a hiccup with them ever since and even if something like that happens again- i'll be able to depend on them to help me to the best of their ability. Definitely recommend!

4.0,0.2679,"I have two complaints about Cleanly. One, even though I requested non-scented detergent in my wash, my clothes came back smelling REALLY heavily of detergent. If you're sensitive to smells-- especially if you're like me and they give you a headache-- this is no good. Two, I don't understand why they charge extra for comforters and blankets that can simply be thrown in with the rest of the wash. I emailed Cleanly before my laundry was picked up, and specified that my blankets and my comforter can be put in with my other clothes, and don't need to be dry cleaned. But for some reason, I was still charged TWENTY FOUR dollars for my comforter and SIXTEEN dollars for my blanket. That seems insane, considering they don't need to be treated any differently than the rest of my clothes.On the plus side, Cleanly does a great job of folding your clothes and arranging them in the bag so they're super easy to put back. They even put your underwear and socks in little packages so they all stay neatly together. However, considering the price-- especially if you're going to wash blankets or a comforter-- I'd recommend another service that just charges by the pound, and doesn't make you pay ridiculously expensive fees for items that don't need special treatment."

As they say, ""good things come to those who wait"" :).My first batch of wash and fold - I hadn't done laundry in forever, and plan on donating most of the stuff since I just moved into a much smaller place - came back within 24 hours and was not an issue. Things get really good when it comes to shirt laundry and dry cleaning. A competitor told me ""we'll let you know when it's ready, and then you can schedule"" (see my other reviews if you want more details). Cleanly had me schedule it before it was picked up, for 2 days later. This morning, in spite of me being very tired from being up too late last night, they came within 10 minutes of the start of the delivery window, I then went back to bed :).Cleanly Reserve (their equivalent to Amazon Prime I guess) seems to be worth it. Since there's no minimum order and a 7% discount on top of that, I can have a routine of sending things out on Friday morning and getting them back on Sunday. There are some things for improvement -  first of all the app is iOS only. I'm an Android guy (but have an iOS device for work, so not a HUGE issue, but wish I could use it on my personal device. They do accept orders via the website I think.....).  The delivery windows could use some work as well - there's only the option of morning (i.e. 7AM to 10AM) or evening (6PM to 10PM) for the start of the window - but in 30 minute increments (i.e. you can chose 7-8, 7:30-8:30, etc).

So yes, this is a REAL review, and nothing phony, made up, or some bogus paid advertisement. This is the cold hard truth. Are you ready?I chose a 10 for Cleanly based on the overall outstanding services, communication, and their commitment to getting clothes clean, fresh, and right to your door. From beginning to end, each process that Cleanly laid out in their new annual plan revamp stayed true to what they were aiming for. The advantages to Cleanly are right in their 'membership plans', that you can try out as a trial and both are different in prices. Worth your money? Cost effective and efficient? Well, yeah. Otherwise, I wouldn't be praising Cleanly for their incredible services.As a first time customer, but avid laundry and tech savvy app user, I was skeptical at first, but I truly wanted to give them a chance. My pick-up time that I chose, was between 9:30am - 10:30am. Cliff came at 9:57am. Upon pick-up, my valet guy, Cliff, was on time, very polite, extremely kind, and basically explained all of what Cleanly was about when it came to the 3 types of laundry bags. (Spoiler alert): I even received a little treat as a welcome token. Who does that?! Very kind and caring! None the less, he even sent me a message assuring me that my clothes were in great hands and that he appreciated meeting me as a first time Cleanly customer. Talk about feeling welcomed.I had a ton of clothes that just simply needed the 'wash & fold' treatment, so there was nothing to it. Got to choose my wash preference, including scented or non-scented detergent. (spoiler: They use Tide, in case you're curious). The entire order took 24 hours, and delivery was on time as well! Well taken care of, well folded, and above all, the valet drivers were super cool, kind, and made my day. I was very happy I thought to change my delivery time frame earlier on, to 9am - 10am, and my valet driver, Elvis, came at 9:31am. Thankfully, no fees were needed for the change (Bonus points to savings on the annual Membership plan) My clothes came stacked neatly, in a plastic bag, covered in their trademark Cleanly bags. Let me tell you...they smelled incredible and (spoiler #2: none of my clothes were ruined or damaged!) I did forget to take a photo, however, I'll update with my second order.In the end, Cleanly lived above my expectations, and I'm extremely happy with the team's application revamp. It's made a huge difference and Cleanly has fine tuned the company into a well known solid brand. No messes here! Just all Cleanly!"

On every occasion, I've used them to dryclean pants, I have requested no crease in their instructions, and they have always returned the pants with a crease.  Even when they have taken it back for a redo, the pants are returned with a crease, which is mind-blowing.2. Items tagged for stain removal are returned with untreated stains.3. The bag I gave them was damaged (torn strap), and they never reimbursed me for it.In the past, they were at least responsive to follow-ups, but now they have stopped responding altogether."
3.0,0.2811,"Proceed with caution...! I've used Cleanly twice and have had below average experiences in both.First Time: - Valet refused to come to my building because he couldn't find parking- Screamed on me on the phone for 15 minutes to drag my clothes 4 blocks and 2 avenues away where he was sitting, to which I reminded him this is a pickup service- Huffed and puffed over here, didn't bring Cleanly bags, dragged my own bags on the floor of my apartment, and I'm sure onto the street- I contacted Cleanly immediately and they gave me a $5 credit and said they would talk to the Valet... Second Time:- Valet cancelled on me for a ""no-show"" - I live in a doorman building and never got a buzz, and no call on my phone- I contacted Cleanly and they decided to reschedule my pickup for the hour after my original - a time that wasn't convenient for me, when they didn't even ask permission- Valet cancelled on me for a ""no-show"" again, although still no buzz or call, and I got charged another fee- I contacted Cleanly again and they credited me back the $5, but I feel like I deserve more compensation! The actual washing and drying has been fine - granted I do send my $hit clothes there only, gym things, t shirts, sweatpants, loungewear that I don't care about. I'd definitely be worried for my nicer blouses and dresses. Overall: valet's are lazy and do an awful job, and Cleanly does little to fix this and their customer service is just plain dumb."
3.0,0.2222,"I wish I could give Cleanly zero stars. I left my laundry outside my door and let the pick up person in. The next morning I walked out of my door and down my 5 flights of stairs. Every few flights I saw a pair of my underwear strewn either on the floor or on the banister. On the last floor, my sports bra was around a door handle. I picked them up and was extremely confused. I contacted Cleanly and only after almost 6 hours of being on hold with the company did my boyfriend finally get a hold of someone. They told us that our entire bag of laundry - not just the clothes that were scattered through out the hallway - was lost. It contained almost all of myself and my boyfriend's clothes and our sheets and towels. It's been 3 days and they still cannot find our laundry. In addition, they have absolutely horrific customer service. When we complained multiple times, were unable to get in contact, spent hours and hours on email and on hold- they had the audacity to suggest loosing the clothes was our fault because the bag of laundry we gave them was 'too heavy'. What?!? Shouldn't they be happy that we gave them business? And shouldn't they be hiring delivery and pick up people who can carry heavy packages? Please, please do not use these guys if you ever want to see your clothes again or if you don't like your underwear strewn around your building. We reported them to the Better Business Bureau, who told us they already have an FFF rating. Go elsewhere."
2.0,0.2511,"NEVER AGAIN. Warning: they will put your ""hang dry"" items in the dryer. They will move your delivery day and time on you AFTER your delivery should have arrived without any phone call or text (after receiving the text that my delivery was scheduled from 9-10pm they emailed me at 9:30pm to say they were bumping me. I don't think I'm wrong In saying a phone call or text would have been the appropriate way to reach out in this instance) And while customer service is nice they are not helpful and when asked to elevate my issue to a supervisor my follow up emails were ignored. NOT. OK. They offered me a discount on my next order and even though I made it clear I will not be using them again and would prefer a refund I never heard from them again. If you care about your time, convenience and the proper care of your clothes don't risk it. Me? NEVER. AGAIN."
5.0,0.1905,"They've changed changed who was doing my laundry and the past moth it has looked terrible.  I went from having perfectly folded laundry that was consistent in size, so it was easy to put up in my drawers, to laundry that is sloppy and not always folded but throw it in a bag. I've taken pictures and sent it to them and all they offer was a $10 credit, I figured maybe this is a one off, but my patience actually gave it a two off, but finally had my last straw when they returned my laundry with both human and what I will assume is cat hair of various colors."
2.0,0.2899,"Let's be honest: I wrote a review for Cleanly because they prompted me in an email for a 15% discount on my next order. My experience since then has been unacceptable, though in their defense the gentleman I spoke with tried to improve the situation to the best of his managerial ability/privilege. I didn't pay for my wash and fold order in the end and I will be honest about that, however as I am now using my Cleanly laundry bag to walk to my friends apartment and do laundry there - I figured this would be a great time to update my review. Four out of five of Cleanlys' valet pick up employees have no idea how their system works or how to operate efficiently. My last order was dropped off and then the valet knocked on my door again after being 15 minutes late for the drop AFTER the one hour delivery window - asking me if he could scan the bag that he just left in order to update his system. I refused explaining that he was already 15 minutes late, making me late for a meeting and no: he could not have any more of my time at that point. This was the drop off experience, after receiving an email at 4 o'clock in the morning 2 days before saying that my card was declined, which ended up being THEIR credit card system error and they were unable to drop off my laundry as scheduled -  on that day holding both my clean laundry and more of my time hostage due to their malfunction. I could not go to work because I had no clothes. In order to rectify this problem, again - they didn't charge me for the wash and fold order however their system of holding your property hostage until payment is received, especially when payment was available and they ran the same card that day and it went through - was completely unprofessional, disappointing and downright awful. Saying ""I'm sorry"" is simply not enough and I would not recommend this service to anyone expecting an efficient, timely or professional experience. I'd consider using the service again once proof of total system improvement is in place, and at least 5 free orders are credited. Otherwise: Cleanly totally sucks."
2.0,0.2385,"Did not receive my clothes after 12 days of doing my laundry with them, I still have not received my clothes. They do not notify you if they will be late or if they will not deliver.

I am so upset and frustrated with this company and the way they deal with their customers, no respect for time.  This is the worst laundry service."

1.0,0.3544,"Five weeks ago, Cleanly lost a bag of my laundry.  All my winter running clothes,  several pairs jeans, tee shirts, socks and undershorts.  They responded to my compaint and itemized list of the lost items several times with ""We're sorry"" and ""We're working to resolve this issue."" They're still saying, ""We're sorry,"" but sorry doesn't replace my laundry that was lost five weeks ago--nor does it provide any reimsursement for my estimated $1000 loss.Update: Cleanly finally responded that their loss reimbursement policy is limited based on the weight--not the value--of lost items. That's one-fourth of the cost of my loss. They offered price reductions for future cleaning, but who would trust them not to lose clothes again?Shame on you, Cleanly.Steve K.Manhattan"
1.0,0.2548,"I am very impressed with the Cleanly team. About 8 of my shirts were ruined when they accidentally got bleach on them. Before I even unwrapped my clean laundry, I got an email from the Cleanly team telling me that some of my items were damaged and that they would reimburse me for any items that were ruined. I sent them links to similar items (being that I bought the shirts a year ago) and they fully reimbursed me for everything without me having to fight or beg. Yes, I am sad my shirts were ruined, but mistakes happen, and I was very impressed with their attentiveness and great customer service. I will most definitely continue using Cleanly."
1.0,0.2758,"I would really really caution people from using this service. I have had one of the worst service experiences of my life with Cleanly. There was one occasion where Cleanly had my clothes and kept changing the delivery date and I had to work around them in order to attempt to get my laundry back. They apologized and I attempted to use them again. This last experience was the worst. When I received my clothing back I realized that my underwear ((which is normally packed separately)) was completely missing. When I reached out to Cleanly their responses were detailed and I was told I'd have to wait ten business days before they could do anything. I expressed the gravity of the situation considering what was missing and they pointed me to their terms and conditions and were not helpful. When they completed their ""search"" they gave me a minimal amount and stated that this was all I could get because of their terms. It is disheartening to say the least when someone essentially doesn't care about service would try and do the right thing, especially when they are the sole reason for the issue."
3.0,0.2816,"Fantastic service and fresh laundry every time! Many things are great about this company, but my overall favorite is the flexibility with their pickup and delivery. I work at an office from the early morning till late the late evenings. Typical dry cleaners/launderers almost never match my schedule and I'm left waiting for a day to finally pick up my clothes. This company will get to you very early and can drop off very late. That is key for me and while I'll be sticking with them."

5.0,0.2984,"Great service! So convenient, the staff is super friendly and always on time within the window. At your first pick-up, they give you high-quality laundry, dry-cleaning, and hand-wash bags to put your clothes in (bags are included in your service!) My clothes come back beautifully cleaned and folded. I love that they let you put in special preferences for how you'd like things washed, and you can even take pictures of clothing items and include specific instructions for those items. It's a bit more expensive than my local place, but I work crazy hours at a hospital and the late-delivery and pick-up are totally worth the cost."

2.0,0.204,"If you like your clothes, do not use Cleanly. I used this service for almost a year without issue, but the last two months have been a disaster involving multiple lost items (first a tie, then a whole bag) and stained items and no follow-up whatsoever from customer service, despite our repeated notifications and attempts at contact. Don't do it."
2.0,0.2562,"Cleanly is great... Until you have an issue. Most of my orders have had no problems but today, they missed the delivery window(9-10). When I tried to call to find out where my laundry was, you can't speak to a person, you can only leave a message or send an email. Finally after waiting for 30 more minutes, I got a text that the ETA was for 10:55 and that a customer service rep would be in touch. That time also came and went and no one was in touch. I finally waited until 11:15 but I had to get to work so I had to reschedule my delivery, which they have charged me $5 for doing. The whole point of this app is the efficiency of being able to select a one hour window for pick up or delivery. Having to wait for over two hours is unacceptable, especially since this place is more expensive than any of the local spots. Looking forward to that call from the customer service rep, if it ever comes, as well as maybe one day receiving my laundry."
4.0,0.1994,"Pick up and delivery were easy, quick, and on time. My clothes came back perfectly folded in their pristine little bag, and I love that I can trust them to actually use unscented detergent when I ask for it. It's amazingly convenient, but my only ""negative"" (to use the term loosely) is that it's pretty pricey and almost all of the promo codes are for your first order!"
4.0,0.1914,"So close to 5 stars... and I think I can update that soon. While I have a laundromat right on my street corner, nothing is easier than the Cleanly VIP program. With the discounts included, and a discount through WeWork, it is the same price. They give you really nice, durable laundry bags. You can easily choose how you want each type of item laundered. They pickup/deliver in 1 hr windows, and everything comes back on hangers or nicely folded. Only issue I have had was with one cycle of laundry coming back not cleaned, but Cleanly fixed this by rewashing everything for free."
3.0,0.2336,"SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT! Cleanly accepted my evening pick up request, I paid for the rush fee for an AM drop off, then hours after they picked up my laundry they emailed me (not called) to let me know that my laundry would not de delivered until the next evening.  When I reached out to customer service to let them know that I had a flight to catch and needed my laundry they did not offer to refund the rush fee, did not allow me an opportunity to pick up  my own laundry which i offered to do and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience.  I will never use this service again. I wish I could give Cleanly ZERO stars."

3.0,0.3079,"I used to use Cleanly all the time and never had issues. However, the past few times they have rescheduled last minute because their valets were overbooked. It is really frustrating when I make time to be home to have laundry picked up, and it's cancelled last minute. They didn't have a time for reschedule pickup until days later. For how much they charge, it's not worth being cancelled on and having to wait days. Also, they used to have many available times, but I've noticed lately they only have pickup times days later and at inconvenient times. I'm not using it again."
4.0,0.2411,"GREAT SERVICE!!!I can no longer complain about having to set aside time to do laundry. CLEANLY services are amazing! My wash and fold, shirts for laundering, and dry cleaning get picked up right from my apartment and were dropped back off within 24hr at a time frame i chose. The website, the personal laundry bag, email updates, and ability to pay via credit card are really great features. Love this service, will continue to use it more in the future and recommend it to everyone who wants to have an AWESOME & EASY laundry experience."
1.0,0.3138,"This company is the Bermuda Triangle of laundry services. I've used Cleanly twice and while the first experience was bad, this second one has been horrendous. Back in October, my hang dry items were left behind -- I had to call several times to get the items returned to me. Now, they've lost an entire bag of my laundry and it's been a massive headache to try to track it down. Did you know that Cleanly has 20 days to do a ""thorough search"" before your items can be deemed lost? Yeah, I didn't either since that information is not available on their website nor their app since the link to their policy does not work. On March 30, Matthew from the support team said he would circle back with the staff to fix the link so future customers would be privy to this preposterous rule but the link still doesn't work.I've emailed back and forth with the support team about reaching a conclusion but I get no more than the same lines parroted back about waiting 20 days before commencing the reimbursement policy. No business that values its customers would make them wait nearly 3 weeks to find out about the status of their items."

They have never messed up one thing of mine, ever. I use them every week - for the past several months... = lots of laundry.The pickup and delivery folks are also always so nice! Very happy with the service and have used many others that just do not compare, especially on the level on CLEAN that cleanly provides. That's what you really want anyways, right??"
1.0,0.2381,"EDIT: Scroll to the bottom and look at the ""not recommended"" reviews...100+ people with similar experiences. Do not be fooled by the ""convenience"" of this service...you'll end up spending more time dealing with their customer service and being stressed and frustrated than you would've saved.A few months ago, Cleanly somehow lost most of my 26 lb order of laundry. Returned to me at the dropoff time was some guy's clothing and couple of pieces of my own. After about a month of emailing back and forth with their customer service (and only receiving updates after following up multiple times), a couple of more items of my clothing were located and returned to me, but I still had to haggle for reimbursement for the remainder. They eventually gave me $750 (which is, honestly, generous, but still doesn't put a dent in replacing ~20 POUNDS of clothing from my closet that vanished on their watch) plus $250 in Cleanly credit. If this happens to you and they tell you the max they can reimburse you is $200, keep pushing. A few days ago I gave Cleanly another chance with my dry cleaning, since each piece is itemized unlike laundry, and because I still had this $250 credit to spend. Within less than 3 hours of the scheduled drop off time, I get a text saying unfortunately my clothing won't be ready and they need to reschedule. This is a minor inconvenience compared to most of my clothing being completely lost, but shouldn't happen to customers regardless. Needless to say I won't be using Cleanly again, and highly suggest you think twice before trusting this company with your wardrobe."
3.0,0.225,"I've unfortunately had two terrible experiences with Cleanly. The first time, they wrote to me at the end of my pickup time that the valet was going to be 20 minutes late (when I was already late for work). They also wrongly charged me for dry cleaning when I had hang dry items. I was refunded, but their valets seem to be very misinformed.The second time, my pickup was cancelled 20 minutes prior, and I rearranged my entire schedule to make sure I was there for it. Not only that: once I received my order, I realized that they misplaced my hang dry items. I stressed to both customer services representatives that I needed these items before a trip and (obviously) it was not noted or taken seriously. I had to purchase new clothing for an event that I needed as a result. My compensation from Cleanly was $5.Additionally, I don't feel as though my clothes were clean. Some came back looking just as dirty as when I sent them off.The one thing I will commend is their customer service. Matthew was apologetic, polite and helpful during each of these instances. Unfortunately, he is one person and not a reflection of the company's service. I will not be using it again."

Only con is that there's a $20 minimum, which with a couple of weeks worth of laundry I could never meet so I'm overpaying every time."
5.0,0.1944,"Definitely does not live up to the hype.  I've been using a local laundry service for years, but decided to give Cleanly a try after my friend sent me a referral code for $10 off.  Cleanly wants to upcharge for doing same day wash and fold (which my previous place did not), also wants to charge $1.50 for each pound in comparison to the $0.80 that my regular place charges. I will say that my clothes came back clean, but they lost one of my high end running socks.  Which now means I'm out a $16 pair of socks, because I can't just use one sock for running.  It took them 10 days to come up with a solution, which was ""here's $8 to use on cleanly"" or ""Here's $5 in cash"" Can't exactly replace my $16 socks with $5.  Needless to say, I will not be using them again or recommending them to anyone else. Stick with the local laundry for better service and faster turn around times."
4.0,0.1894,Very convenient and reliable. Always on time. Definitely great value. Sometimes I'll come across a random sock or underwear in my order which is the only negative I've come across. I've never lost anything that I know of though.
1.0,0.3363,"Cleanly asked me for my feedback...so I figured I'd share here too...the only reason for the second star is because they didn't lose my clothing as another poster has mentioned. Are you really sure you want me to answer this??? I think Cleanly sucks as a service and the ""concierge"" are a bunch of pompous jerks who speak down to you when you have a valid complaint. 1- Cleanly said my method of payment was not accepted (ApplePay)...so I went on and entered the exact card attached to that account and *magically* it worked. Btw thanks for letting me know at 9:15pm when I was in bed and needed to get up to grab the EXACT same card (did I mention that??) 2- My hang to DRY clothing came back wet, not damp, wet. I'm very accustomed to doing my own laundry and it was quite evident my items had been washed that morning. When I inquired I was met with a generic and frankly rude response essentially explaining the process of laundering to me....thanks for that. I was told there were many factors that influence why the items might come back wet, there was absolutely no accountability taken. If you washed the hang to dry items upon receipt, it would control many of the ""factors"", its laundry, not rocket science. 3- It was of poor quality and expensive. I've used other laundering services for half the price and my items came back in way better condition.4- You've lost me as a future client and if you have Yelp you can expect a ""lovely"" review from yours truly as well.Glad you asked. Have a nice day"
3.0,0.2111,"The idea is to save time, but I ended up having my time wasted by Cleanly. The pickup was fine but the return a disaster. I was supposed to get my clothes back between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m. and at 7:45 I called to find out if there was a slight delay. I was told there was a delay of about three hours. Why I wasn't informed of that earlier than when I called, I'm not sure. But I don't have a doorman and needed to wait for my clothes which is why I requested the 6:30-7:30 slot so I could go on with my day. Not using this app again."
4.0,0.2447,I've had a really good experience with Cleanly so far. Things come and go on time and I love that they are using tide and not using fabric softener.

4.0,0.2468,"Been using cleanly for about 6 months. They haven't lost anything (which is a plus for NYC laundry service) and they've never been late. No concerns with any of the actual laundry, though I admit I have not tried to wash anything complicated with specific instructions. The overnight service is a plus with cleanly reserve. The shirt pricing at $2.85 is a bit steep for me, but they do a good job with them. Overall I'd recommend for ease of use."
1.0,0.2127,"Stay away from this company. I enjoyed their services until recently. On my last order, my dry cleaning was delayed for over two days. Then a new driver dropped my clothing off in the wrong place. My dry cleaning was stolen and I lost over $800 worth of clothing. I contacted them to let them know I will be pursuing legal action and nobody has contacted me to follow-up. Please stay away from them and try other services that will actually care about your personal items."

It was easy and convenient, I also ended up getting stuck late at work the day it was supposed to be delivered and I liked that I was able to go into the app and reschedule my delivery at no charge for the following morning. Pick up and drop off times were both within the first 20 minutes of the estimated 1 hour timeframe and the valet guys were very friendly! I received my laundry back clean and perfectly folded. I'll definitely use this service again!"
0.0,0.2471,"I really enjoy using this service. Even though they lost a couple of my towels, the customer service reps were EXTREMELY accommodating. They followed up every couple of days to provide a status and then reimbursed me with credit when they weren't able to find them (with options to be reimbursed in cash). Luckily, these were just towels, but, I was very appreciative with the way they handled it. Since then, the service has been impeccable-- valet is on time; and I can tell by the way they return my clothes that they take the time to properly care for each of my items."
1.0,0.3394,"My experience with this service was absolutely atrocious in a surprisingly varied number of ways. First and most importantly, when our multiple loads of laundry were delivered on Monday evening, a whole load was MISSING. When I contacted them about this, they said they'd take 7 business days (business days being Mon-Fri despite the fact that they are open on weekends, giving them a total of 9 days) to figure it out, and keep us apprised. After 3 days of our continuous checking in with no new information from them, they told us they had delivered the laundry to another customer and would send us pictures in the next couple of days to confirm. This never happened, and after continuous contact from us, they keep giving us the ""we will sort it out within 7 business days"" line.So, now it's Monday, a full week since the laundry was supposed to be delivered, and I am out of clothing. We don't know whether our laundry has actually been located or is missing, and they have been completely unapologetic, saying they have until Thursday to deal with it (I don't know who does their math).They have not even refunded this order!!! Additionally (and be *very* aware of this if you use this service), if our laundry does end up being missing, they will only replace each item with ""7 times the cost of CLEANING it."" Meaning that at $1.50/lb, a $15, 0.2 lb pair of underwear would get you a reimbursement of (up to!) 30 cents! At most we'd get $200 for clothes worth at the very least 4 times that.There have also been a fun assortment of other issues (the valet not bringing enough laundry bags necessitating a second pick-up the next day, delivery being delayed, a tiny bleach stain on a dark tee, a $20 groupon marked as having been applied to the total but them charging the full amount and it taking countless customer service interactions for them to fix this).At this point, I don't even care, I just want my laundry back. I will never be able to afford to replace what I lost given their reimbursement rates, and I loved that stuff.Outrageously bad. For your own sake I urge you to find another laundry service."
3.0,0.2207,"Cleanly has recently switched to a model where couriers are now employees of the firm. It now takes 3 days to schedule a pick-up and they are extremely unreliable. I scheduled 4 pick-ups last week, none of which were successful. I didn't get an email or a text, and the customer service representatives were extremely unhelpful and dismissive. Stay away!"
5.0,0.2026,"This service is very effortless - they come to pick up and drop off at your place. Prices are competitive with others in the city. The only recommendation I would ask for is to bring back their personalized bag ... I received it on the first cleaning and when I sent it back, it disappeared."
2.0,0.215,"Good idea and nice customer service, poorly executed. After some back and forth with them realized they are simply a high tech middle layer - your laundry still goes to the same sweatshop wholesaler your local dry cleaner sends it out to. There are no pleasant trader joe employee happy hipsters gingerly doing your laundry at a cleanly owned facility. If anything goes wrong or there is inconsistency, they can still blame it on the vendor or say they are just getting started and bear with them. Nice to have interface, app, and text message, but simply paying a premium for same old laundry service. Laundry bag came back ripped after first try, gym clothes still smelt like sweat, socks and underwear not folded or inconsistently folded and some missing. Only had two try's so no horror stories like whole load went missing so I am sure some people had good experiences.Very similar to synergy maids who they were spun out of it. My first few tries with synergy maids were extremely inconsistent and frustrating but after raking management over the coals several times they finally got it right and are now quite pleasant and very convenient. If you've got the time and energy to go after them until right or you just really don't care that much about your laundry, give then a try."
5.0,0.2194,"Great service.  They have the fastest turn around time compared to similar laundry services I have tried. Pickups and Deliveries are always on time.

0.0,0.2211,"I've been a frequent Cleanly customer over the past year, but when I moved to Brooklyn the Cleanly customer service and actual laundry third party vendor has been absolutely disappointing. I even had to repeatedly email Cleanly to get my money back, actually a CREDIT back even after showing them pictures of my clothes still wrinkled and with stains on them. Come on, a credit? I was almost willing to use them again until they told me that it is not guaranteed when exactly they'd tell the dry cleaners that they failed to actually clean my clothes. As someone whose spent more than $500 over the past few months with Cleanly, I'd expect a refund and some coupons on top of that. If you're in the midtown Manhattan area, Cleanly is great and their service is great as well. But, Brooklyn, beware."
4.0,0.2339,Cleanly has been great. I started using them a few months ago. I had an issue with the pick up of my first order and their customer service was quick to answer and helped resolved my issue. Ive used them about 5 times since and love it.

1.0,0.2132,"I've used this service for a bit happily but am now going to stop. DON'T PAY FOR MEMBERSHIP. I pay the highest level of membership and was guaranteed rush delivery overnight and not only did they change that at the last Minute it's now going to be almost two full days without a drop off. I wouldn't have sent ALL my laundry out if i knew they'd screw thjs up since now i have a trip to go on and no clothes for it. I emailed customer service twice and no response and finally called and the woman couldn't do anything for me except move the delivery up by one hour. No refund or compensation and I was told that escalated management would get back to me in ""several days."" Way to treat high paying customers. Lost my business for sure and will tell other friends in the city not to try."
4.0,0.2406,"This service is such a lifesaver. Door to door service with extra care in each load. My line of work/study has a lot of variation in schedule and workload, so it's nice to be able to depend on Cleanly when I have too much going on to think about laundry. The customizable options for laundry are nice, though I really don't care how my laundry is done. Price can seem a little expensive, but it's worth every penny. It saves hours of time that could instead be spent hanging out with friends, doing work, etc. Also nice that they offer dry cleaning so it's a one stop shop for all of your laundry. The valet's are always friendly and prompt, and keep me updated on the status of my order. The one downside to this service is that after using it, you'll be too lazy to do your own laundry again."
0.0,0.2121,Great service and super convenient.. very response to any feedback and issues! While you may pay a minor premium for the service it is well worth it.. clothes come back clean and nicely folded.
2.0,0.2591,"Avoid this service at all costs!! BY FAR the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Valets do not come to your door often, and will either just leave things at your door step with out knocking, or not show up at all. Just this week the following have occurred on 1 order.1. Valet was supposed to arrive Sunday. Called me asking for my address (which was already in the application and my order), then no-showed and didn't answer his phone. He subsequently claimed I was a no-show and charged me $5 for the ""no-show"". 2. 2nd Try Valet comes back on Monday. Arrives 30 minutes late, with no notice.3. Receive bill for ~$100, which included 30+ pounds of someone else's wash and fold clothing, as well as 3 sets of bedding (not mine), someone's dry cleaning.4. Received ""adjusted bill"" that was even higher, after I called support and relayed all these issues.5. Spoke to support again for 30+ minutes, who sent me pictures of clothes and items in question. I pointed out specifically which items were not mine, and she assured me that they would not be included in the delivery, and added that the valet would WAIT at the door and take back any other items that weren't mine. 6. Valet doesn't call or knock. I find the clothes outside my door, with no valet around. I have 30+ pounds of clothing that are not mine, dry cleaned shirts that aren't mine, and 3 sets of sheets and multiple towels that aren't mine.7. Clothes of mine are lost.For one that outsources their laundry, the notion of losing clothes is frightening, as you send off your often expensive clothing to a service with the promise that they are taking care and protecting it from being lost. For this to happen and the customer service associates to be so irresponsible is scary. I would recommend anyone to use RINSE, and NEVER use this service. Rinse I have never had a problem with and they are quick to apologize and fix an issues they caused with compensation or otherwise. PLEASE DO NOT USE CLEANLY."
3.0,0.2135,"I have used Cleanly for over a year, initially I was very happy with the service. However, they made a change in their concierge model (previously contract workers but they moved to hiring part time employees directly) and their hours became very limited, when they were running late they would often cancel and change the delivery to several days later (as one worker told me ""to avoid having to pay staff overtime"") and their prices went up as a result of this change. A service fee on all orders on top of delivery. This charge was even applied to people paying monthly for the Cleanly Reserve membership (which includes free shipping, etc). My last drop off instructions were not followed. I requested the clothes be brought to my door so I could ensure all the pieces were there, but they left the items with the doorman.  When my boyfriend picked them up, my hang dry items were not there. It has been over two weeks and I have not received an update on my missing items. The customer service is horrendous and overall quality has went down significantly. I would not recommend using this service."
4.0,0.2791,"I highly recommend Cleanly to anyone who doesn't have a washing machine in unit or in their building. I've used it 4 times now and it has worked out great. They have three options: wash and fold, wash and hang dry, and dry clean. I have only used the wash and fold and it was very well done. I love receiving my clothes back smelling great and nicely folded. They also have a rush option (which I haven't used) but it is helpful if you need your clothes back sooner. All in all I am a fan."
4.0,0.3122,I LOVE Cleanly. I had seen an ad for it and was a bit skeptical (as my previous building had a laundry room and I did it myself).  The experience has been amazing.  The app is very easy to use and super flexible based on your laundry needs.  They provide you with a bag to use and will send you notifications when they're on their way.  I haven't had any complaints at all about the the laundered clothes either; comes back smelling so fresh and clean. Highly recommend!
1.0,0.2131,"I've used the service 3 times. Initially impressed with delivery flexibility and customer service until they LOST AN ENTIRE ORDER of 7 shirts I sent out for cleaning. They didn't lose one shirt - they LOST THE ENTIRE ORDER. They offered to pay me at 10x the cleaning value per lost item ($2.85/shirt), but this nowhere near covers their value and my out-of-pocket expenses. Not to mention that lost/stolen property of any kind is a total violation of trust; especially when you champion your company as a service provider. My advice: stick to your local where they know your face and respect your personal property."

It seems expensive up front but if you calculate it out you will more than make up for it."

2.0,0.2368,"They misplaced my laundry and sent me the wrong bag (everyone's nightmare).After responding promptly last night and sending me a picture of my laundry sitting in their warehouse, they have been radio silent this morning after I had requested a time of delivery. You'd think a situation like this would be top priority for their customer service team.In addition, the customer support line goes straight to voicemail so there really is no way to quickly resolve the situation and for them to provide comfort to the customer. You're stuck waiting for an e-mail response. I still have no idea where my laundry is at the moment and whether any items are missing.Of course, it's a good app and UI, but a lot of work needs to be done in back-end logistics, quality control and customer service. My local dry cleaner never misplaced my laundry in over 4 years."
0.0,0.2667,"I'm a big fan of the convenience of using Cleanly.com. I can order laundry service through their easy to use app, the prices are only slightly higher than my neighborhood laundry services and I can track my pick-ups and deliveries. I couldn't give them 5 stars though as they have some operational bugs to work out - pickup/delivery has been late on more than one occasion. But overall the service is good and I'll continue to use them."
4.0,0.2222,"Every single thing about this process was seamless and amazing. Laundry that gets picked up at 8pm and dropped off the next morning at 6:30am sounds unreal, but this is the real deal. The app sends you a reminder and a pic and info on your driver as well as an actual locator tool that allows you to see their exact location on a map. They are super professional and friendly, and most importantly, on time( no wondering if they may or may not be on time). I feel like I should be a spokesperson for this company, because I literally have raved to everyone I know about them."
1.0,0.3073,"DO NOT use this service!!!They lost 29 lbs of my laundry. And they still have no idea where it went. They also were deceitful when they initially lost my belongings- they told me twice that the delivery was just delayed. They then told me that they were sure that another customer accidentally got my things and they would return them to me shortly. This was also not true. They partially reimbursed me for my belongings and acted like they were doing me a favor by going ""to the greatest extent of their policy"" but I am still out several hundreds of dollars replacing the items that they lost.You should know that they do not actually do the laundry- they're only a middle man. You do not need this service. They make it seem like they actually do something. They do not. Just use your local laundry wash and fold- it's not worth it to lose your belongings when there's an extra transition with this unnecessary, irresponsible middle man."

1.0,0.2425,Best option I've found for laundry in NYC thus far..  Good but not perfect.  The 3rd month using them they lost a pretty large amount of my clothes (never found despite my immediate and thorough descriptions).. I ended up getting a Cleanly credit but the amount I got was no where near the amount I paid for the clothes (their policy is pretty weak on the max amount they will reimburse for lost items so just keep that in mind).  Wish they didn't have the minimum order for delivery... But Definitely do the one month free of Cleanly Reserve.. It's the best option if you have frequent and small loads like me.

2.0,0.2875,"This service went from stellar to extremely poor. My laundry was 24 hours late. I easily had $120 worth of laundry - pick-up was normal on Saturday and promised the regular drop-off on Sunday. I've used Cleanly at least 10-12 occasions. Every time it seems to get worse. It's hit rock bottom.On Sunday, I was alerted at 6pm that my 8pm delivery time wasn't happening and that it was going to be delivered the next day. Yes - 24 hours late with a 2 hour notice. Monday wasn't going to work - that's why I asked for Sunday drop-off. After calling their support, I was told due to the Papal visit, my laundry was going to be late. The papal visit was Thurs-Fri. My laundry was picked up Saturday evening. It seemed like a narrative they were telling all their patrons. He also mentioned someone would reach out to me - here we are 24 hours after that, and still nothing. No call, text, email, etc. nothing. He mentioned he'd give me $5 off my next order. $5? That's an insult seeing my order total was $120. My laundry was delivered - late again. No apology. Plus, my laundry was done differently than I specified. I asked cold water/light heat. No way was that done. No way. Clothes shrunk - they failed to do what I asked. I'm not sure what happened to this business, but it's gone down hill. I gave them an excellent review when I first began Cleanly, but it seems they care more about getting new clients, than keeping their existing, long-term clients happy. The $5 won't be used, because at this rate - I won't be using them again."
4.0,0.23,Great fast service where they give you a personalized bag to use for pick up and drop off. Always on time and app is super easy to use. Better then folded as the personalized bag makes it easier to drop off with a doorman or leave for pick up

2.0,0.2492,Cleanly lost our laundry:(My fiancé and I had a huge $48 dollar bag of laundry(no towels-all work and gym clothes) that was supposed to be delivered last night from the 9-10pm window. The bag accounted for 50-60% of our total wardrobes. We got the text message that the laundry has been delivered even though we did not receive it. We immediately reached out through  both email and phone when we realized we did not receive our laundry. We were consistently told that the employee was saying he had delivered it although he hadnt(at least to us). Cleanly-please help us find our laundry!Such poor execution is very frustrating. We have been paying 1.50 a pound -2x the cost of the usual service because we believed cleanly was more trust worthy then the usual laundry service .

Clothes always come back feeling clean and fresh, and being able to track pickup and delivery with a face and name makes me feel even more comfortable with the service."
3.0,0.2208,"First the good - Their wash and fold is great and I haven't had anything in wash and fold lost, other than a few socks.  They separate everything and the price is about the same as places in my area but I can schedule the pick up and delivery.  I don't have a doorman so this works best for me.  Their drivers also come within the window every time. They also do a hang dry for a nominal extra fee which is nice for my athletic gear.  Sometimes it still comes back damp though so I don't always opt for this.The Bad - They are consistently losing DRY CLEANING.  If I am dry cleaning an item, its probably a lot of money and I am pissed that its missing.  Their customer service SUCKS.  The last time they lost a shirt, they didn't even respond to me by phone or email.  Then, as I said it would be, it was at the bottom of the bag and not cleaned.  I will not be using their dry cleaning services again for this reason.  Also, twice the driver made me come down to get my things like out of my apt and walk to his car because they couldn't find a legal parking spot.  This is NYC, if you aren't willing to pay the guy's ticket or for another guy to stay in the car, then don't call yourself delivery.  One guy wasn't even near my building.  The laundry is heavy and this is a problem for me.  The app doesn't have a tip feature either.  Sometimes I tip in cash, but I don't always have cash on me and this is annoying. Also, their prices are a little high.  If their service was amazing, I could understand it, but it isn't - again their customer service SUCKS.  You are basically just paying for the delivery time.  If that matters to you, then use them.  If I had a doorman and could have laundry dropped off anytime, then I would never even use their wash and fold."

Since I've started using Cleanly, though, my collection of running socks is nearly extinct. They just never come back. I received an order back today that included one sock that definitely doesn't belong to me.

I had high hopes and was eager to love it because I hate lugging my laundry to the crowded laundromat 5 blocks away.The pick up/drop off and customer service is good -- it's easy to book a pick up/drop off, the people who come are friendly and professional and it's not hard to get someone helpful on the phone if there's a problem (which there was).The problem is they lost a few items and gave me a few items that weren't mine. I am not sure how something like that happens and the customer service people were nice in trying to help - but that doesn't bring my items back, or give me peace of mind that that didn't lose anything else that I didn't notice (I didn't keep track of exactly what was in the couple weeks worth of laundry I sent -- but you should I guess, if you plan on using them). For the price, they should be taking better care of your things.Unfortunately -- and important to know ahead of time -- the reimbursement policy is based on weigh of the item, and of course that won't be even close to equivalent in price that will cost to replace whatever they lost. So not only did I spent a lot on this service, I now have to spend more to replace what they lost. Sadly, not recommended."

I've learned my lesson and haven't done that since, but now only use Cleanly for wash and fold."

I thought to myself ""no problem, this happens all the time."" The most recent (and probably final time) I used Cleanly, I sent off a very expensive custom made dress shirt and it was returned to me with the top button broken and the fabric around the top button torn all the way through (pictures attached). I've used many dry cleaners in the city, but none of them have cost me this much money in such a short period of time. I hope you guys have better luck."

I don't mess around with clothing; it's expensive, and I do need it back. All of it back. Haven't been disappointed, they do a superb job, better than any laundromat I've used. Everything is properly cleaned, sorted, organized and wrapped in plastic, even matched socks. I appreciate the flexibility and the ability to change drop off and pickup times. I'll update this review if something eventually goes wrong (which seems to be a common theme with these services; it's good up until the point they screw up in the worst way possible) but for now it's a 5/5. I hope it stays that way. One thing I miss is same-day service; i understand this is probably logistical nightmare for the Cleanly people, but for me, and probably a lot of other users, we'd be happy to pay a substantial premium for that service. It's the one thing local laundromats have that Cleanly lacks."

5.0,0.351,People don't write reviews unless the service was extremely good or extremely bad. This is the first time I had to write a review because the service was BAD. DO NOT use this company. They literally take your dirty clothes and place it on a hanger and put it in a bag to give the appearance of it being dry cleaned. The first time I used them I had brought a bunch of clothes to be dry cleaned and the service seemed good. But who can tell right whether clothes has actually been cleaned when the clothes are brand new and doesn't have body odor on it. But this second time using them the clothes I got back straight up had the odor still on it. As strong as when I gave it in to be cleaned! This must mean they are just taking the clothes and placing them on hangers and returning them back to customers! Do yourself a favor and go to your local and RELIABLE cleaner. This company is a scam.
0.0,0.2361,"I have tried many of the laundry delivery services in downtown manhattan and hated them all, which is why I'm happy I found Cleanly. Pros:They have reliable, short delivery windows and even same day bookings online. The prices are fair for the service. I'm always happy with the cleaning itself.Cons:Cleanly struggles with some laundry basics, like folding. For a premium service charging a premium price, I would expect the folding to be on par. For example, they often fold shirts so that you can't see the front of the shirt. So, if you have 4 black shirts with different necklines, you have to unfold them all to tell them apart.There are issues with the bag they provide. If you stuff it full, close the drawstring, and use the handle, the tension from the handle pulls the drawstring open again. So I'm always slightly afraid my clothes will fall out.Also, I wish they had an android app!"
1.0,0.2539,"Cleanly I started to use your service the moment you expanded to Midtown. I've been a big supporter of you and made sure I recommended you to as many people as possible. After spending the past 5 months and over $500, myself not including my boyfriend's account, I have to say goodbye. Growing a company is hard and I respect what needs to be done at breakneck speed in order to make sure you are using your investors money to expand to new markets. Issues will happen to anyone but adjustments must be made.Clothing is one of the most personal items that a company can get involved in, and losing items is something that no one wants. Our clothing connects us with our memories of people, places and much more. Although there was prorated compensation for the items I had receipts and online listings for, it still stings.Their detail receipts help you find out if something is missing from your order when you have ""tagged"" items like wash and press and dry cleaning, but a customer shouldn't have to use them to double-check the delivery was complete. They will come back to you at some point, just be vigilant. All of this are just variables that compounded on a decision that was really sparked by an email exchange that went public to us when their Community Manager Natasha B said ""I f*ing hate him"" regarding an exchange with my boyfriend and their COO saying ""He is such an a*hole. It will be an honor to send him away."" This type of language shouldn't be included in any email or chat, have we learned nothing about communication from other big PR issues with other companies?I write this as informative, not with malice or ill harm. Thank you for the fun ride, but I must say goodbye."
5.0,0.2205,Cleanly is extremely convenient and the clothes come back really well washed! I would give them 5 stars for service. The four stars is only due to the price which is a bit high to wash with them all the time. I will definitely use them when I can.

2.0,0.2496,"UPDATE TO PREVIOUS REVIEW:I felt I owed a caution to those who absolutely need their clothes back by a certain time. I booked a vacation and sent my laundry out with Cleanly in the AM for a PM delivery as I was leaving town the following evening after work and wanted to pack some clothes that needed washing. I got a text from a rep at Cleanly a few hours before I was supposed to receive my laundry back letting me know they would not be able to deliver on time and would have to reschedule for the following evening. I responded that that would not work for me as I was leaving town and needed the clothes by the following morning, latest - period. I could not reach anyone by phone call to talk through the issue in detail. I texted them I would rather have my clothes delivered back uncleaned/as-is because I needed them before I left but they for some reason could not give me back my clothes, even unwashed, which was concerning to me. The reason for 3 stars is because I received the clothes on schedule when I returned from vacation and they were cleaned to satisfaction, per my usual experience. Bottom line - if you absolutely need your clothes by a certain time, wash them yourselves or take them to your local laundromat to be safe."

My clothes came back smelling like me. They should have at least smelled clean. I had to promotions, and if he gave me a discount for the inconvenience.

5.0,0.233,"I've been using Cleanly regularly for the last six months. I've never had a problem - the app is easy to use; the valets are always on time; and clothes are laundered/dry-cleaned as per the instructions. I'm a fan of the ""hang dry"" feature and appreciate that they separate lights and colors and give you the option of cold/hot wash. I've had to reach out to their customer service on a few occasions, and they've been extremely polite, prompt and helpful. I pay the annual subscription which gets me free hang dry, free delivery and a discount on every bill. I think it's a great deal! The only downside to Cleanly is that you don't get the option of same-day delivery that you'd get with your neighborhood laundry service."

4.0,0.2281,Cleanly has been amazing so far! I started using the service a few months ago after not being able to find a decently clean wash and fold place in my new neighborhood. I also love cleanly's options of hang dry and the temperature you want your clothes washed and dried on. Overall a great service! Wish it was just a little bit cheaper!

2.0,0.2257,"Worst dry cleaning service out there. Gave the company 6/8 of my dress shirts to wash and press. 30 minutes before they were set to deliver them they informed me they would be delayed 24 hours. I was leaving on a business trip so that was NOT acceptable. Requested them to just deliver my dirty shirts so I could get them cleaned at my hotel, but they informed we that was not possible because the facility was closed.So it is now right before my business trip and I have only 2 shirts for 2 weeks. The company gave me just $5 off my order... NOT helpful when I now have to pay for cleaning at the hotel or buy new shirts. Cleanly is NOT a reliable service. Definitely do not use if you are a business traveler."
0.0,0.2335,"After having tried out several other services (from local offerings to FlyCleaners) I am still beyond impressed with Cleanly. The app is simple and easy, the service is prompt, they have the highest quality delivery bag I've found, have never lost my clothes after several (+6) months of use, and my clothes come shrink-wrapped in cellophane each time! Next stop, The 5th Element! Only improvement I could offer is to give customers the option of adding $5 to get a hand scale to know before people come if you meet the minimum pound requirement."

1.0,0.2563,"We decided to try Cleanly after some negative experiences with Hamperville. Bad choice. On the plus side, their website and use of automated communications is far more effective. But they messed up our laundry service in almost every way possible. We specifically requested scent free detergent and our laundry came back reeking of detergent. They also sent us someone else's underwear. So we arranged for them to pick-up (with the stranger's stuff marked) and redo. The pickup was delayed more than a day. Then the return delivery was delayed twice. When we finally opened our laundry, the scent was gone, but the foreign underwear was still there. The whole process took a full week, and was not worth it. We're back to doing laundry ourselves."
1.0,0.2538,"I just got my first order back and was shocked to see the hems completely pulled out of 2 of my work skirts. There's no way that could have happened by accident - someone had to physically rip apart the hems.This service was supposed to simplify my life, but now I'm going to have to find a tailor and get these items repaired (and be without 2 main pieces in my work wardrobe for even longer). I'll upload photos of the damaged items as well."
5.0,0.3355,"I used this service once on the recommendation of a neighbor. I will NEVER be using it again. My wash and fold items, which consisted of a set of sheets, were fine. But my dry cleaning was treated terribly. I had 5 items, 3 of wish don't seem as if they were actually cleaned in any way and 2 of those 3 were ruined. I had a white sleeveless blouse that was shrunk significantly and has red/pink stains all over it which were not there before and a white cardigan sweater which has a burn mark and/or black plastic gunk melted into one side of it. Another white blouse doesn't seem as if it was washed at all. Overall I was obviously extremely disappointed in the service, never plan to use it again and will never recommend it to anyone. I am still waiting to hear from their customer service but am hoping they will do the right thing and not only refund the order but the price of the ruined items."

We have only had one delivery that wasn't ready at our scheduled time, but Cleanly emailed me ahead of time and rescheduled for the next day. I always appreciate communication."

1.0,0.3333,"As mentioned below, Cleanly is great until you have a problem. Then they're terrible. I sent a brand new white dress to be dry cleaned before I took it on vacation (had only worn it one time). When I got my laundry back, I took the dress out of the bag to find an enormous brown liquid stain across the front that had not been there previously. The whole dress looked a shade dirtier as well. I emailed them immediately with pictures of the dress and a screenshot of the dress for sale online as I had recently purchased it. All in all, my dress cost $268 and cleanly only refunded me $125 plus some credit. I took a loss for their mistake and they took no responsibility for the enormous stain. They said their policy only allows them to reimburse 10x what it costs to dry clean the item- terrible policy if you plan to dry clean anything other than t shirts and undergarments. I'll never use this service again - they need to reimburse customers the appropriate amount for damaged items. They won't be in business for long if they keep treating loyal customers like this."

They picked up within minutes of my scheduled time slot beginning, and dropped off just the same. The person who dropped off the clothes managed to make a 4th floor walkup with a heavy bag of laundry-- I was impressed. The clothes came back perfectly folded and easy to organize. My dry cleaned dress came back in perfect condition. Would definitely recommend; and they come to Brooklyn!"
1.0,0.3013,"I loved using Cleanly for the first 4 months, then they lost three of my shirts (value at about $200 - one was brand new!) and offered a paltry cash reimbursement ($45) and credit toward future orders. Losing socks and underwear - fine. That's not at a great cost to me to replace and not unexpected from a laundry service. However, to say that the only value assigned to my clothing is based on weight is unfair and losing multiple shirts is not insignificant to my wardrobe or to my wallet. Also, providing credit is not appealing as I am now wary of trusting them with my clothing. As well, it took significant follow up on my end to get any traction on finding the items and on the reimbursement, which was frustrating.  Just this morning I had signed up for their VIP service, but have now decided to cancel."
5.0,0.2325,"The service is arguably one of the best for wash and fold and their laundered shirts service is nice as well. Promotions crop up pretty regularly, however many of these are for specific services like dry cleaning which I don't usually need. That being said, I wish the wash and fold prices could come down just a bit from $1.50/pound. If that could be managed, Cleanly would be on top in no time."
4.0,0.3554,"Ahhh Cleanly. Where do I start?! The relationship began two months ago. After moving into my new apartment, I found that the biggest struggle for me was laundry. I live in a 6 story walk up and the nearest laundromat was a 15 minute walk away. Carrying 20 pounds of laundry back and forth was beginning to become a burden, but then Cleanly came into my life. It was love at first click. Creating my order was so simple and the app is beautiful!! Then hours later this wonderful amazing being arrived at my door and took away my laundry. They helped me with all the questions I had, PLUS I got chocolate. Yes you read that right, CHOCOLATE. I received my laundry the next day and it was smelled so damn good. I was hooked ever since.Cleanly is like that amazing boyfriend that comes into your life after you've been struggling with a horrible one for so long. Thank you for making my life easier!!!"
4.0,0.2463,"I started using Cleanly when I move to the city and the closest laundromat was 5 block away up a very steep and long hill! I needed a convenient and trusting laundry service. My friend told me about Cleanly. After the first few services I immediately became a reserve member. In the 2 years I've been using cleanly only one article of clothing shrunk. I contacted the customer service - boy are they AWESOME! - and they right away asked me to send them a pic which they will follow up with a reimbursement. Another time they accidentally dry cleaned my jeans, which was very nice of them but totally unnecessary, and of course they reimbursed me for that over charge as well. I tell all my friends about this service and can't imagine doing my own laundry again."

Placed an order for between 9 and 11 am? They'll be there, 95% of the time, right at 9 am on the dot. 2) They're very friendly. 3) They'll weigh your laundry right at your door to give you an accurate cost estimate. 4) You get chocolates for joining!5) The laundry always looks and smells fantastic.6) The app is clean, beautiful, and easy to use.Seriously.

3.0,0.2739,"Consistently late. Double charged. Overall, bad service.The past three orders I've put in with Cleanly have been delivered egregiously late. The most recent was supposed to be delivered between 7am and 8am on Friday morning. I was called at 8:30 am to be told that they would not be able to deliver until 7pm that evening and that they were still trying to determine where my dry cleaning was. After making me late for work and moving my delivery, they then charged me double and attempted to say they needed to keep both amounts on hold until my laundry was delivered. Still working to get them to credit back the extra charge. This was the third time Cleanly delivered my clothing late (as I write this, I still dont actually have my laundry yet so who knows when it will arrive). The previous two times, they delivered so late that I needed to move meetings around and hunt them down to find out when I could expect my laundry to be delivered - they have vague phone numbers and general emails so its impossible to get someone if you're having an issue."
0.0,0.2459,"Cleanly really is the best option for dry cleaning in NYC. I've been using Cleanly for about 2 years now and have not had one issue. There are constantly promotions going on to make it even better to use the service. By scheduling time slots, the pick up and drop off is always predictable. Before turning to Cleanly, I had horrible experiences with dry cleaners near my apartment building and was skeptical to use an app. However, it has proved to go above and beyond my expectations. I recommend Cleanly to anyone and everyone. While it may be slightly more pricey than other cleaners, the quality of the service from delivery time to product is always superb. Highly recommend!"
5.0,0.2808,"These guys are WINNERS. Laundry seems like such a simple thing - how can so many (literally hundreds) of small laundromats/services screw it up? It's baffling because laundry doesn't just seem simple, it actually really is simple. How hard can it be to NOT:* lose my clothes* shrink my clothes* destroy my clothes* somehow make my clothes smell worse after ""washing"" them* lie about washing my clothes* burn my clothes (yes, it happened!!)* always be lateTangent/rant, Cleanly review resumes next paragraph:Not to get spicy, but FlyCleaners has a special place in hell. If Cleanly had an evil twisted sister, it would be FlyCleaners. Everything FlyCleaners does wrong, Cleanly does right. FlyCleaners outsources everything and has become this pathetic colossal operation that doesn't give a damn about customer service. They're a fancy app that facilitates a stranger destroying your clothes in some far away land.Anyways, back to the superstars here. Cleanly rethinks EVERYTHING.I really admire how cautious Tom was when launching this service. I have no connection to him, but I tweet a lot and for months asked him to expand to the East Village. Cleanly took its time and only grew when they were ready. And wow, are they ready!!!He wrote the app from scratch. It works great. The delivery people are nice. They always arrive on time. They give you chocolate. They weigh the bag in your apartment with a travel luggage scale to give you an estimate. They wash your clothes correctly. They sort correctly. They follow your demanding instructions correctly. They deliver your clothes on time with a smile at a price cheaper than most laundromats (!!!!). You are absolutely bonkers or just plain ignorant if you're doing laundry any other way. YES, I am judging you as you haul your bag of laundry down 14th in the blizzard since you probably paid more than if you were to use Cleanly. Yep, I think you're stupid (or probably lying) if you say you have to hurry and dip out so you can grab your clothes before the laundromat closes. This is 2015, we live in the most populous city in the country, I'll get my clothes cleaned through an app. Thanks!This isn't a jab at Cleanly, but like I said above, laundry in general really isn't *that* hard to do. Sure, there are a lot of things that can go wrong, but it's not hard to avoid them. Cleanly changes the game by being the only ones who seem to be able to pull it off well. Cheers to them."

4.0,0.2585,"I've had a great experience with Cleanly. I moved to Manhattan in August and started living without a washer and dryer for the first time. I didn't want to spend hours in a laundromat. I could save money by dropping off and picking up my clothes from my local laundromat (they charge .99 a pound and Cleanly charges $1.50), but I enjoy the convenience of my laundry being picked up and dropped off at my door. They have always been within the one hour window when picking up and dropping off. I do wish the detergent they used was more strongly scented because I like for my laundry to have a strong, fresh smell, but I'm sure many people who are sensitive to scents like it how it is. My hang dry clothes always come back wet, but that doesn't bother me. I will continue using them to do all my laundry."
4.0,0.2622,"I have been using the cleanly app for about 10 months now - usually sending laundry out a few times a month.

No issues with the laundry itself, the attendants are friendly and prompt (only maybe 3 times have arrived outside of the 1 hour window by 5-10 minutes). Laundry was my biggest frustration when moving to the city and Cleanly solved that! Highly recommended."

I have to say I am pretty impressed with my experience, I downloaded the app which was really straight forward and easy to use and I had a driver at my door the next morning to pick up my clothes. I received my clothes back the next evening, they were neatly folded and I even got a free laundry bag and found my old one folded at the bottom. All in all a great experience."

I placed a new order, got it back, and looked at my receipt. They tacked on about 80 dollars worth of false dry-cleaning charges (they allow up to 12 hang-dry items that you place in a specific bag labeled ""hang-dry"" and they charged me as if they were dry-cleaning). This way, they got out of paying me for my lost shirt. To add salt to the wound, I discovered recently that they lost another 70 dollar shirt of mine. They do not pick up their phone when you call. I will never use them again and will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau/contesting their charges on my credit card."

Instead of the fresh, wrinkle-free, hung-up shirts I receive from similar services, I got a bag of wrinkly, balled-up button downs and - most importantly - my expensive tee-shirts shrunken down to the size of an American Girl Doll..

Also, I even have laundry in my building that is cheap, but why do I choose to spend more and use a service? TIME! I recently have started a new job that has resulted in less and less ""free time"" and laundry was becoming a big time suck that I couldn't afford.

I would love to be able to have an early morning pickup and a late night delivery option.+ More expensive than other services, the dry cleaning is a bit ridiculous in my opinion. However, I continue to use it because the quality remains high.I hope they expand into house cleaning, if they can bring this quality to maid services, I'll hire them!"

I also love the ability to set my wash and fold preferences for good - so creating a new order is just a few taps. I find that their delivery is on time within the hour window about 90% of the time, and they text if they're ever stuck in traffic :)"
1.0,0.3366,"Cleanly in theory is really convenient - unfortunately in practice they've lost my laundry twice in the past three months and getting a refund is an obnoxious waste of time. In January they lost my dry cleaning and it took maybe 10 long (LONG!) emails back and forth with customer service before they'd accept that my clothing had been lost. Multiple emails from them asked me if I was sure I didn't have my dry cleaning, was I sure it wasn't folded in with the wash and fold, was I absolutely sure it hadn't been delivered. Obviously I'm sure and that's why I'm emailing. Had to wait the 20 day period and then when I emailed them on the 20th day for my refund it was more back and forth which resulted in half a refund for the cost of my dry cleaning and half in Cleanly credit.Then in March my boyfriend used Cleanly (not realizing that was the service that lost my dry cleaning) and they lost my hang dry items. We're currently in the 20 day waiting period for those and I'd bet my own life they won't find them and will try to issue us more Cleanly credits (as if we'd ever use them again) instead of a proper refund.Even if they didn't lose my stuff they're never (NEVER) on time returning your clothes. My 7:30-8:30pm delivery usually shows up around 9-9:30 and sometimes even later but that's really just the crappy cherry on top of the crappy sundae."

They're clearly more interested in building up profit than taking care of your clothes carefully. Seven months after the last incident, they've redesigned their app, but they're still paying no attention to taking care of clothing.That said, they tumble dried (again) my hang dry items. I put them in a separate bag as instructed, clicked the little ""hand dry"" button on the app and everything comes back clearly tumble dried, pilly, elastic sticking out - what happens to delicates when you put them in the dryer on hot. I would use extreme caution in using this service and not send sensitive items. They've probably ruined another $300+ of clothing because I chose to give them another chance."
5.0,0.331,"Well my first review was January of last year so I have been using Cleanly for the whole year probably once or twice a month for $100+ each time.   They have gotten progressively worse.  I write on the app my preferences and in big BOLD permanent marker on the bags....cold water/low heat.  I have complained several times to them that they have shrunk numerous of my clothes to the point where they need to be thrown out.  They have offered me half hearted guarantees that those are the setting they use on my clothes and that all fabrics are different and blah blah blah. I have kept using them because of the convenience and I keep telling myself they guaranteed me it wouldn't happen this time.  But of course it happens each and every time.  This past time was the final straw.  I had to throw out 5 nice expensive sweaters that I have never had a problem with in cold water/low heat.  But for some reason cleanly uses cold water/low heat and they turn into toddler clothes.  I also included my all fabric cotton blend shower curtain which takes heat every time I shower.  Now it does not even reach down to the tub that is how much it shrunk. Every thing else was shrunk too but I was able to rewash and recover most of them to their original size.  so basically I had to pay to wash them and then pay again to wash them myself.   My clothes also come back with detergent stains on them, which causes me to have to rewash them as well.  All of these things I have brought to their attention and for some reason it never gets fixed.  So I am done with Cleanly. Steer clear if you value your clothes."
3.0,0.2903,"I am only giving this two stars instead of one because my experience prior to this past week was pretty positive.  I have a job with sometimes crazy hours and my local dry cleaner was unreliable with pickup/dropoff so I started using Cleanly last year.  The app is easy to use and the customer service was very good and helpful the one time I had a problem with a pickup.  This past week, I ordered a dry cleaning pickup for Saturday.  The driver was late and I did not get an ETA so I requested via the customer service phone line that the services be rescheduled for Monday.  On Sunday, I get a text that someone came by that morning for pickup when I was not home.  I called customer service again and now they said they could not get me a pickup until Tuesday between 7-8 am.  I wake up at 650 on Tuesday and wait, putting off walking my dog before work and other obligations.  8 am rolls around and no one shows up.  The text help number tells me that there was a mistake so they have to reschedule again.  I now am coming up short with clothes for work.  Thankfully I did not have an important meeting this week, but I will never use Cleanly again."

2.0,0.2004,Excellent service. I received a text like usual that my laundry was delivered. My doorman had no record of the delivery and couldn't find it in the package room. I of course panic as I was leaving for a trip overseas the next day. I called Cleanly and even in my panicked state the woman on the phone was beyond friendly and professional. It turns out they have their valets take a photo of the lobby of the building where the laundry is dropped off! So impressive (and a smart business practice). Photo in hand I went back to the doorman and after some time they track down my missing laundry bag. I'm so glad I signed up for Cleanly's Reserve service and would recommend to anyone.
4.0,0.2442,I am using Cleanly for few months already and i am not planning to use the laundromats directly anymore.I just love this simple experience. with only few clicks i can schedule my pickup and drop off and forget about my laundry.. I hated working with the laundromats directly because they were not always nice and friendly. with Cleanly app i don't need to deal with that anymore. someone will pick up my laundry and return it clean to me. no headaches anymore :)
5.0,0.3559,"Had to downgrade my review after my most recent experience. My full length dress was crammed into a suit garment bag and the bottom of the dress was   Wet crumpled, defeating part of the purpose of sending it out. The biggest issue is that they put a stain on my top which did not have a stain on before going out to them. I contacted them to try and remedy the issue. Customer service was great, they responded quickly and organised for the dress and the top to be picked up free of charge to reprocess. Again, they collected in a timely manner as is customary for them, but the dress was returned in the same suit garment bag, crumpled again and the top was returned in the same state - with a stain. The top was an expensive (to me) silk Frame blouse which was a treat for myself last year. I have requested a refund for the ""cleaning"" of the ruined blouse and compensation for the cost of the blouse but have not heard anything. I am sad that they didn't respond because I would have given them another chance for past good service, but not anymore because they can't fix or acknowledge their mistakes. I would not want to send anything to them now for fear of them ruining it and not being able to acknowledge or fix the issue."

2.0,0.355,"AWFUL service. I scheduled my delivery early since I had a trip out of the country. I was waiting for my laundry before receiving a text saying it would be an hour delayed. Fine, totally okay, it happens. I then received an email saying it wouldn't be delivered at all and would be delivered the next day.  Problem was I would be leaving for my trip out of the country the next night and had washed all my clothes for the trip before hand. I replied back to the email from customer service and they said they would deliver it the next morning between 7-8am. PHEW...except it didn't come then either. I spent HOURS the next day after multiple emails and calls and being on hold for 20 mins then getting forwarded to a voicemail saying no on could answer my call. After panicking all day, I FINALLY get in touch with someone after being on hold and they told me my laundry had been delivered to another customer...WHAT?! You gave a stranger all of my belongings?! Are you KIDDING ME???! Ridiculous and I will NEVER use this service again or recommend it to anyone. Disgusting, unprofessional, and not worth ANY type of premium laundry pricing. If you value any of your belongings, you will never trust Cleanly with them."

My last and final order one of my Lululemon jackets was missing. They couldn't find it and reimbursed me only $40. I asked for a reimbursement on my membership to which they replied, ""we can't reimburse this but please continue you using its benefits until March 10, 2018."" Very poor taste and customer service if you ask me. Those jackets run upwards of $140 and for them to not credit my membership back was salt in the wound. I do not recommend using their services."

3.0,0.2222,"Really one of the worst experiences for me. The pickup and delivery were fine, they brought me a new laundry bag since it was my first time using yada yada yada. The fun part? They shrunk every pair of pants I own by a very noticeable amount, like I would need to lose 20 lbs and shrink to be able to fit back into them. Of course it happened to be the time that I had a ton of laundry so I'm seriously in disbelief. I have probably used 10 other cleaning services without having a problem so I'm not sure what kind of system they are using? Maybe they thought I was a contestant on The Biggest Loser? Worst."

3.0,0.2667,"I decided to try cleanly for the first time this past week and was pretty disappointed. First, my pick up time got pushed back a day. If there's no one available for the time I want, then it shouldn't be listed as an option on the app. At pick up, the valet did not have the bags as a first time customer as promised on the app. My drop off time then got pushed back a day again! On top of all this, the drop off time was supposed to be between 7:30-8:30am but kept getting pushed back and wasn't actually delivered until ~11:20am - almost 3 hrs late (almost making me late for work)!! If my laundry had come back perfect they might've gotten a higher rating. Unfortunately when I went through my laundry, I also had some socks missing and a tote bag that doesn't belong to me. Overall more stressful than I had anticipated. A positive was their customer service. Both valets were friendly despite having to walk up 6 floors and my total was discounted by 50%, which I appreciated given how much went awry with timing. Might consider giving them another chance but only after my disappointment with this first experience wears off."

5.0,0.2426,"I really wanted to like Cleanly. In fact, initially I did when I started using them about 6 months ago. However, the service has continued to decrease with every single order. The last order I received back my whites were completely tie-dyed with dark stains because Cleanly failed to separate my whites from colors as advertised. They tried to correct the issue by cleaning the whites again for free, which didn't do much for the stains but I was over it, and let it go. I said I wouldn't use them again, but I've been traveling like crazy and haven't had any time to do laundry. So for my convenience, I crossed my fingers and scheduled an order. I received my clothes last night, as as I'm going through them today I realize they are still wet. This is absolutely unacceptable. Cleanly is too pricey to offer such unsatisfactory service. I don't care if I have to hand wash my clothes, I will never use Cleanly again."
1.0,0.2596,"Started out well...but had multiple issues over the course of the last several months.First, had a couple pair of dress pants disappear - Cleanly proceeded to question if I actually left them with my doorman, then asked if my doorman still had them (or were hidden somewhere in my building). They swore they spoke with the guy who picked it up and he was absolutely certain he NEVER picked any pants up. After lots of back and forth, they agreed to reimburse me - most of which was just given as Cleanly credit. Several weeks later the pants magically showed up in their factory. No apology - no one reached out admitting that the concierge was wrong or apologizing for insinuating my doorman was lying to me.Several months later...several expensive items of clothing went missing from my wash and fold and I received some items that were not mine. Process to investigate missing items is too long (20 days) - had to buy a bunch of new clothing for a business trip.Too many issues make the service unreliable and thus I will be sending my cleaning elsewhere."

2.0,0.2166,"They lost my laundry, and my roommates laundry, within the same week. They also stained a white silk shirt that I sent out for dry cleaning. The customer service is pretty awful: they don't have a phone (or rather, don't answer it) so when you lose something you have to wait for email responses which come (roughly) every 6-10 hours. I asked for them to call me, or to give me the number of someone I could speak to repeatedly, they would not. Eventually, I got my clothes back. The bag was ripped and my laundry was no longer folded. All in all, just a really terrible experience. I definitely would not recommend. Just walk to your neighborhood laundromat, it's probably not that far, it's cheaper, and at least you can talk to an actual human if something goes wrong."

3.0,0.2174,"This service is great. They work exactly as advertised.

When the delivery arrived the blanket wasn't there. I got in contact with the support team to explain the problem and they got the blanket delivered to my apartment right away, within the originally designated delivery time. This is by far the best costumer service experience I've had. Very trustworthy"

1.0,0.3308,"Update: My clothes were found and returned a few days later. However, my brand new Anthropologie Pillow Shams were still missing. They never found them. Now the shams are sold out. They also didn't fully reimburse me for them because according to their policy, Cleanly will reimburse 10x the cost of laundering the item! They believe they went ""above and beyond"" because they actually reimbursed me for the price I paid for one sham, and the rest of the money was reimbursable in the form of Cleanly credit. Why would I ever use Cleanly again after all of this? That credit is a waste--why not just do the right thing and credit my credit card instead?"
2.0,0.2527,"I bought the $50 for $30 deal. Then, I placed an order for dry cleaning. While checking out, there was no option to enter the code. The next thing I knew, I placed an order. I thought ""okay, maybe I will give the code to the guy when he picks up or drops off my clothes."" No, that wasn't the case. He said you enter that online. I messaged the business and it took them a while to get back and by then I was out of the country. So, all they ended up doing was manually crediting my account theb $50. But this is already after spending $30. So, the deal ends up being $80 for $50 which is nowhere near the same, especially since there are better and cheaper full service dry cleaners nearby. If they want business and good reviews, then they need deals and excellent service/convenience which I did not experience. I suspect they set up the checkout so you can't enter the deal easily the first time and end up getting stuck giving them more business. Would have gave then another star had they got the only stain I had on my 3 items."
5.0,0.2495,"I used cleanly once and was very pleased with the level of service.  The valet who picked up the clothes was the same one who returned them and he was very kind and polite.   I like the garment/laundry bag and the chocolates were a nice touch.  I'm not sure if fabric softener was used in the wash/fold, if it was I couldn't tell.  I prefer fabric softener but that's just me and I wish it was an option.  As for the hanging laundry it was OK.  One of the shirts came back more wrinkled than I expected.  My sweater took an extra day because they said it was not cleaned to their standards which is odd because it wasn't dirty, I just like them to be fresh, I had worn it twice. One of the shirts either came back with stains (the look like light grease stains) or they were on there and I didn't notice.  Either way, they should have been addressed.  I may use the service again, I am a little on the fence.  If you are not super particular about your laundry then I would say it's the perfect service.  If you are a little more particular it may be best to do your own laundry.  For pure convenience it is a great service, maybe a little fine tuning to make it a stellar service."

5.0,0.3324,"I really wanted to like Cleanly. I loved the convenience of the app and the man and woman who picked up and dropped off my laundry were so friendly and nice.

They came back soaking wet in a sealed plastic bag, smelling worse than I could have possibly imagined. In all my years washing my athletic clothing, I've never experienced such a bad odor. The clothes clearly were shoved straight from the washing machine into the bag without so much as an attempt to let them hang and dry. My clothes (over $500 worth) are now ruined. They refunded me $10 after offering to redo the service, which I declined as they also said the ""hang dry is out of their control."" I took my ruined clothes elsewhere to try to salvage them. Unfortunately, I will never be using Cleanly again."

The only negatives are that it's a little expensive, but I understand that their service requires that, and that I have trouble hitting the minimum weight for wash and fold, so I'll run out of things I wear often but not have enough total laundry to meet the minimum, which can be frustrating and costly.

2.0,0.4229,"One star because they eventually returned my clothing. Just kidding, one star because I can't give less than one star on Yelp. Also, I'm not trusting any review from Daryush, who clearly was asked to bring up ratings, and if ya'll get a code for reading his review, I'm sure Daryush gets some $$$ too. Let me tell you, nobody can offer me a discount big enough to use this service again. I have spent over 400 dollars at this business, ignoring some slightly annoying things like drivers being 10-20 minutes late, the occasional random underwear in my wash that isn't mine, and the perplexing things like how my shirt comes back more wrinkled after a wash and fold than when I put it in. I am telling you this, to highlight that I can be a reasonable person... Last Friday, I lost my sh*t.  I go to unpack my clothes, and find out they're not mine. Now, I reacted like any person would who felt their clothes were missing, but I calmed myself down and gave them a phone call. I called, because I don't believe this situation is one anyone wants to deal with via emails. Let me try to sum things up here... (but seriously, you should only need to read a reason or two before you are assured that you should not be a customer here) 1) I was placed on hold, then sent to voicemail. This happened repeatedly, and it was during business hours. Why was I told someone would be with me shortly, and then sent to voicemail?  I left a decent voicemail. Then a more concerned one. Then an impatient one. I never got a call back. 3) I sent an email, and that's when I had the pleasure of speaking with Melissa H., who needs to be sent immediately to every customer service training there is. Besides her canned responses (see all of her replies to reviews for examples), she ignored my request to speak with someone. When I later spoke to someone (more on that later), I was told that it's policy that Melissa can't pick up the phone and call. Listen, I wouldn't trust Melissa to handle a customer service call either, but at the very least, she could be instructed to state that policy instead of just ignoring a customer's request. Then, probably due to a lack of actual judgement and just a copy + paste response, the emails focused on picking up the clothing that wasn't mine. A reasonable request, if there were also some sort of CANDID acknowledgement that it's upsetting to have my clothes missing, some reassuring lines about the measures you are taking (this eventually happened when it was no longer reassuring), and maybe letting me know what would be done in the event my clothes were not found. 4) Dealing with something like this via email is like having a fight via text (don't). Nobody wants to sit there and wait by the computer for your responses to simple questions. You had one job (and I paid for it). You effed up that job. So you pick up the phone, so that someone can actually hear any sort of candidness in your voice, and so that you can field questions. 5) Well, since nobody called me, I had to use the power of social media. And wouldn't you know it. Less than 10 minutes after taking to Facebook and Instagram (I was so close to starting a Twitter for ya'll), I get a call from the manager. I had a very reasonable conversation with this woman because she's actually been trained in customer service, (please train the rest of the crew). 6) So my clothes were found the next day. Melissa and I continued our email conversation. She asked what time the following day I would be available to do a clothes swap. I say 10:30am. I had to email again to confirm that people would actually come at that time because I got zero response. Melissa emails me at 9:30am with the subject line ""you missed your pick-up/delivery"" -- At this point, I just gave up on her. Again, why is this so hard? I remind her in writing I said 10:30am because I knew I wouldn't be home before then, so now I have to wait until the night time on a Sunday to get my clothes. She says 9-10:00pm. 7) My clothes arrived late, because what else would you expect. My bathmat was somehow dirtier than when I sent it to be cleaned (the bathmat they charge you extra for because according to Melissa's canned responses, they take extra care for those items. Just.. lol) And of course, a handful of the signature more-wrinkles-than-ever clothing that Cleanly is known for. ***Once I took to social media, I noticed other people complaining with issues. I don't care what the issue is. I understand mistakes happen, but if you look, everyone's complaint is that they simply ignore you, refuse to call back, and just straight up not deal with the issue. Had someone called me back (or picked up like they should during business hours), and followed simple customer service guidelines, I would have likely forgiven the mistake*** NEVER AGAIN."

5.0,0.268,"As parents to a newborn, my wife and I turned to Cleanly as a time saver.  For a little while, things were working out and we were willing to pay extra money for the convenience of not having to take our laundry to the local laundromat. I wish now that we had checked the yelp reviews before entrusting Cleanly with the majority of our clothes. Earlier this week, we had Cleanly pick up several dry cleaning items as well as a very large bag (26 pounds) of mixed clothes. Dry cleaning was dropped off last night but our large bag of clothes is nowhere to be found. After contacting Cleanly, it is clear that Cleanly lost our bag. Appallingly, their first response was to offer us a $5 credit, which even if we had clothes left to wash and were stupid  enough to use Cleanly to wash them would cover only a small fraction of the cost.  They said they are currently contacting other customers to see if our clothes were mistakenly delivered to them and checking their warehouses."

Cleanly not only lost my entire dry cleaning order, but they were not helpful and continually brushed off my questions about where my cloths went.

1.0,0.2829,Not worth it.  They have high minimums and they have lost several pieces of clothing (both in dry cleaning and laundry).  Clothing comes back smelling like it is over dried.  They also lost a brand new dress that was dry cleaned. They cite some lame return policy that is buried on their site (if you are using the app on a phone it is buried too).  Now they are not offering to pay the the full cost of the dress even when I produced the receipt (it was weeks old and the first time the dress was cleaned).  On top of that I offered to take it in a credit for services instead of cash (no cost to them) but they would not budge. That is no real cost to them.

5.0,0.2046,"We been using cleanly for about a year. It is more expensive than usual wash and fold places, but we figured the late delivery option/ease of the app/ease of payment was worth it (the only reason for two stars). A couple of months ago he started complaining about holes through the hems of his cotton shirts (all quality V necks, polos, undershirts) but I didn't think much about it. A few weeks ago my boyfriend asked if a white pair of athletic socks in one of the bags were mine. I said no and he tossed them. Right before Thanksgiving I found a pink Loft blouse and a pair of patterned J. Crew pajamas that did not belong to me. I know that some wash & fold places pin your clothing together and throw different people's loads into the same commercial sized washer/dryer, unpin, fold and deliver out. Given the random items we have received and holes I guess this is what has been happening. I am also starting to doubt that I (for the first time ever) neglected to re-pack two dresses and a bra and am pretty sure that some other woman got them delivered with her laundry...Also, for the price point socks could at least be matched up.P.S.- I told them to send a valet to get whoever's stuff I have and they told me they would with my next pickup. I told them I am not interested in another pickup so now I am being forced to hold someone's stuff hostage."

It was my first time using a laundry pickup & delivery because I was always scared of this happening to me. I'm not talking about a few t-shirts either. I'm talking A LOT of my clothes.

3.0,0.2146,"These people are actually amazing (shoutout to Andrew!). I used to use Flycleaners and I have to say my life is vastly improved since using Cleanly. I've had situations where I was not home when they tried to deliver and they cheerfully changed my delivery time, or when I was running late and they actually waited the 5-10 minutes until I got home. They are extremely punctual, highly reliable and overall it's been an absolute pleasure being their customer. I once sent a dress in to be dry cleaned and forgot the hem had fallen out. Rather than just cleaning it and probably causing further damage, they called me and asked how I'd like it to be handled, called me back with a hemming price quote (extremely reasonable, I think $10-$15), had their team hem and clean the dress and then delivered both my laundry and the dry cleaning on time. I cannot say enough good things about this company. Oh and they bring you chocolate! The only suggestions I have would be 30 minute pickup/delivery windows as opposed to an hour. Oh and if they extended the Cleanly brand to things like house cleaning, closet organizing, etc. Either way, they earned every last star. I'm hooked and will be a long term customer."

1.0,0.2352,"Not a trustworthy service. Service is not bad ""IF"" they do not lose your stuff!!! couple of issues:1- I used them 3 times and they always brought the items back to my apartment but last time they claimed that they left them with the doorman and of course there is no sign of my items. Problem is customer service. I gave my stuff to the valet and I receive them from valet. I was there in my apartment the whole time waiting for delivery that never happened and they are yet to take responsibility and reimburse me for my stuff.2- They claim that they wash each customer's items in a separate machine. I doubt it. I specifically asked my valet to make sure that my stuff are washed separately from other people's and she said ""I have to check with the facility to see if they can do that"". WHAT? it's on your website. I am taking my business somewhere else. Thanks."
5.0,0.3572,"I'm in the midst of sending my first order and given the problems I'm encountering came on here to check out reviews. I'm happy to see all the positive reviews but am actually quite surprised given the terrible customer service. Earlier this week I sent an email inquiring about the price of dry cleaning a queen-sized bedskirt, to which they responded that it would depend on the size and fabric and that they normally only do clothes. This was confusing since I gave the size and if an item can be dry cleaned it shouldn't matter the fabric. Also, they list a multitude of bedding items both in the wash and fold and dry cleaning sections so clearly they do more than clothing. I decided not to send my bedskirt and instead bagged up some towels and bedding to be washed and a few sweaters for dry cleaning. When I emailed again asking where to specify special requests (a few items need to air dry) I was told to leave them in the pickup/delivery instructions. I assumed this was for instructions regarding picking up or delivering the items since it gives options about leaving with the doorman, etc and not about how to handle the clothing. I was also informed that only 4 pieces can be air dried. What?? I don't understand the arbitrary number nor is it helpful if you're someone who regularly has things that need to air dry. In a subsequent email I was informed that the items may not dry in time and therefore would be sent back wet. What?? Why am I paying to have my things cleaned to have them sent back to me wet? I'm hopeful that this isn't an indication of how my items will be handled. The idea is great in concept but is missing the mark. I wish they provided more information on the website/app and also made the process of placing the order easier. I ending up taping notes to everything specifying if it was wash or dry cleaning and how it needed to be handled. It would be great if when placing an order they had boxes you could check to specify which items go where so you know that they know to dry clean your shirt and not launder it. At this point I'm just hoping my items come back to me clean and without any problems. I'll update next week when the order is returned."

1.0,0.3566,This is my first yelp review and I'm pretty fired up.  Cleanly was OKAY - until they lost half of my clothes and couldn't find them.  The whole process of considering my clothes lost took over a week.  When I first got my delivery back all i got was my sheets and towels... and someones else's clothing completely.  Good news they found out that this person had my clothes.  Not so good news it wasn't all of my clothes.  So while they ignored me for a few days it turns out today they cannot find the remainder of my clothing.  They offered $40 dollars based on their policy while I lost well over $300 in personal items - some that can't be replaced.  Clothes don't just disappear someone has them and Cleanly cannot backtrack to locate.  Instead of updating your app to a way less user friendly interface you should be working on a smoother process for ensuring clothes do not get mixed up and lost.
5.0,0.2806,"First few pickups (wash/fold) were fine, but instructions for dry clean were not followed.

There has been an ongoing issue over the past two months with about every other laundry delivery being returned to me slightly damp and not 100% dry (i.e., ~90% dry), and I was in touch with customer service about it. I should have just stopped using their service at that point but continued to give them the benefit of the doubt because customer service was very receptive when I contacted them about the issue of the laundry not being fully dried. Also they had been very good until about two months ago so I thought they would be able to improve things and not send back damp laundry. Then tonight they returned a soaking wet pile of laundry."

2.0,0.2374,"This service is terrible because there is no customer support. After Cleanly lost suit slacks valued at $400 I repeatably tried to contact them. I left messages and wrote numerous emails. No one would call me back or answer any of my questions via email. Even though their reimbursement policy is terrible (will pay 10 times the dry clean value = $65 for the lost slacks), getting them to pay is near impossible. There is something to be said for a dry cleaner that you can actually walk into and speak with someone.  I understand that mistakes happen and if anyone was willing to get on the phone with me and just talk through the issue i would have given them a 2nd chance. Avoid Cleanly at all costs. The crazy thing is after I told them that they lost my slacks and that I have someone elses dry cleaning, Cleanly has never made an attempt to come get the other person's dry cleaning back from me.

Other times my clothes had been shrunk (despite specifying cold and no heat), my clothes had new pulls and snags, and the texture of my clothes suddenly became scratchy.  I used to take my clothes to the laundromat down the street and wash my clothes myself,so I know it's not the quality of my clothing. I have tried giving cleanly several chances, esp since the customer service reps have been pretty nice and responsive; they offered to rewash the scratchy clothes. I swear though that I've gotten someone else's socks on two occasions (my bf didn't recognize them)."
3.0,0.2303,"I rarely write reviews, partly because I'm lazy, and partly because I think people who nitpick are pretentious and irritating, but in this case Cleanly deserves to be praised. I grew up in a household where we were expected to do our own laundry, since I was tall enough to reach the buttons and was trusted to not to chug the detergent bottle while mommy wasn't looking.  Of course this all changes when you no longer have access to your own laundry machine (oh how I took that for granted.) So when I made the move to the big city, the thought of someone else doing my laundry was foreign.  While I'm not covered head to toe in designer fashions, I like to wear nice clothes that require extra care.  I was very worried handing over some of my most prized possessions (I work in fashion so naturally I'm shallow) and unmentionables to total strangers. For the first few months I was lugging my laundry down 2nd avenue, sweating up a storm prior to starting a 10 hour work day, and rushing home before the 6:30/7 cut off time, which put me right back on 2nd avenue, lugging away. I thought to myself: there has got to be a better way! I started using fly cleaners for a couple of months and while it was good in the beginning, I noticed that my clothes started slowly disappearing, and my detailed instructions were starting to be ignored (like drying delicates on high heat, WTF Man?) The straw that broke the camel's back is when they sent back all of my clothes folded inside out.  One of my favorite things about getting my laundry done is how neatly they fold it (something I was never able to master) so I can easily place it directly into my dresser.  I couldn't fathom paying all that money for a half ass job. But there was no going back. I was totally addicted to the on-demand laundry service. I blame my roommate for introducing me to this new designer drug. I decided to look elsewhere and stumbled upon Cleanly, and I am over the moon! Let me tell you the ways:1. Their delivery people are insanely nice, like really really nice. The kind of nice you don't experience in this city too often. It's like they found the nicest people in the world and hired them. Mr. Rogers would work there, and would be considered the ""office grump"", that's how friendly they are2. My Clothes are always exactly how I ask. I have a lot of delicate clothes, some with very specific instructions, though I hate being so particular and needy (I never complain at restaurants, I hate sending back my order, etc. I pride myself on how easy going I am) they never make me feel guilty and do it with a smile on their face 3. They have yet to loose any of my clothes. While I'm sure this will eventually happen as their business grows and have more orders to keep track of, they seem to have a great system in place4. I sent in an expensive and fairly new blazer to be dry cleaned.  They sent me an email notifying me of  a tear at the seam on the sleeve (probably something I had done while having one to many at the 13th Step, shameful, I know) which included a photo. They asked if I wanted to continue with the dry cleaning.  I said it was fine and for them to continue. I figured I would just take it to a seamstress myself. To my surprise Cleanly replied: ""I spoke to our facility manager, and although we don't offer alterations at this time, she agreed to sew the tear. It will be free of charge, and we will put it to cleaning after. Have a great night!"" I couldn't believe it. It made me feel warm and fuzzy inside, and not like that warm and fuzzy when you drink a bottle of wine on an empty stomach. More like the warm and fuzzy you feel when you see dolphin and dog best friend. Most companies these days won't go that extra mile for their customers. Thank you Cleanly, for reminding me that there are still are companies (and people!) in this world that give a damn. 5. They are always prompt and timely, even with my early mornings and late nights 6. I totally forgot about my laundry drop off (my fault since I ignored the reminder texts while walking home and talking to a girlfriend on the phone) And walked up to my building where my cleanly valet was patiently waiting for me in the snow. I felt sooooo awful and she was so very sweet about the whole thing. I tried to tip her extra for her troubles but she graciously declined. Her name is Nicole, so Cleanly if you are reading this give her a big raise since she is very kind and patient with clueless idiots like myself.  7. The app is clean, simple, and beautifully designed. Super easy to use especially for busy professionals who don't have the time to drop off/pick up laundry 8. Totally unexpected mini box of chocolates that they give you when they pick up your first order. I had mine for breakfast, so so good. Obviously I'm a little obsessed, but I can't help it. So give cleanly a try! You won't regret it!!"

4.0,0.2682,"I like doing laundry, but it's really inconvenient in my building. Fortunately, I *love* having my laundry done, especially the part where it comes back all compressed into a perfect fabric cube. But never before have I used a service with such a perfect interface--from the pickup and delivery people to the top-notch customer-service email team to the sleek, friendly app. It's more seamless than Seamless. It's not just that your laundry gets whisked away, washed, dried, pressed, dry-cleaned, delivered. It's squeaky-clean without being perfumey, perfectly folded (I challenge the Gap/Army to do better), and thoughtfully sorted. Every time I've had a question or request, they've answered almost instantaneously. I love them and couldn't recommend them more highly!"

0.0,0.25,"Cleanly used to be great, but then they dyed my white sheets blue. They offered to re-launder them, which I declined since a) I didn't feel like waiting and b) I doubted that they would be able to get the blue out. They then offered a refund for my order, which I accepted - but it's been almost two months and they still haven't processed it properly. I had to follow up today with an email. The people in customer service are nice, but like pretty much every other on demand laundry service in Manhattan, Cleanly seems to have a vendor management problem and demonstrates limited accountability."
4.0,0.1922,"Wonderful customer service - kept me updated on the status of my laundry the entire time via text. I got 2 free laundry bags and a garment bag, chocolate and a discount for first timers. The lady who picked up my laundry was very friendly and answered all the questions I had about the service. What is there not to like?:)"
4.0,0.2695,"Ive been on the UWS for around 7 years now and had probably switched laundry services about once a year. Now this may seem excessive, however it was due to the fact that they either lost entire loads of laundry, weren't open at the right time, couldn't really follow through on agreed delivery times and charged more than they should just for some wash and fold. Clearly I was in search of something that would be WAY better. As luck would have it Cleanly started on the UWS & UES and I immediately gave it a go. I was hesitant at first (cause how could something so simple to use actually follow through on everything after the order was placed?) but that quickly subsided. What an incredible job this team does. The app incredibly easy to use, looks awesome and takes all the effort out on my end. The follow through on communication (via Text) is great - I know step by step whats happening. The actual pick up and drop off? I love the fact that they weigh it in front of you and that they are quite possibly the nicest people ever.The price point - $1.50/lb for all of the above? Yes please. The options for more than just wash and fold? Winner. The occasional deals and discounts are awesome too - I donated bags of clothes for $10 credit per bag and that was beyond amazing. 2 birds, 1 stone. (donating to those who need and having it picked up with my laundry)All in, I have to give it 5 stars - in 4 months of using it not one thing has been wrong about any of it. So happy to have this service."
4.0,0.2053,"Cleanly could not be more convenient. Select pickup and drop off times from their app, and wait for their friendly people to arrive - so far (4 orders) they've always been perfectly on time. I've used wash & fold and dry cleaning services and both were terrific - and actually cheaper than my neighborhood cleaners. They also provide you with your own laundry and dry cleaning bags so it's really easy."

The app is super easy to use, the delivery guy was super nice, called me in advance to make sure that I'm comfortable with the time that I chose :) the clothes came back clean, pressed and organized.

After downloading the app and getting my first order back, I'm happy to say I'll use the service again.

3.0,0.2554,Just a warning to people who set their drop-offs before work in the morning- my order was delivered an hour later than the allotted time tonight. Kind of surprising. Usually have a better experience with Cleanly.
0.0,0.2459,Do not use this service.  Not only is the quality of the dry cleaning horrendous (I'm convinced that my pants weren't even dry cleaned because they still had all the creases in them from wearing them) but they even lost items in my pick up.   Save yourself the trouble and find a good local (and maybe organic) shop by you that has a delivery option.  Who knows what these folks here at cleanly are doing.
4.0,0.3025,"I absolutely love this app. Not only is the design amazing, it is also so easy to use. I hated doing laundry and Cleanly has drastically increased my quality of life and clothes! I barely folded my clothes before and now with Cleanly my clothes come back to me clean, smelling amazing, and folded beautifully. They are always on time and their valets are so nice. They are the crème de la crème of laundry. I no longer have to stress out about laundry!"
0.0,0.1982,"I've used Cleanly 14 times over the past 6 months and think they are excellent. The pickup/delivery people are friendly and always come near the start of the hour window. The app is very easy to use, lets you choose your pick up and drop off times and specify any requests you have (i.e. dry low, wash cool etc). My laundry comes back clean and folded with hang dry items in a separate clear bag. The few times I've had to contact support with requests or questions they have been very fast and super helpful. If things continue like this, I will happily continue to use cleanly indefinitely."
0.0,0.2533,"Very friendly people working for this company. Service is prompt and they did a good job with my laundry.

1.0,0.2647,"Recently raised there prices and then managed to lose ALL my hang dry items in a single order. There is no customer service number, just an email. They are searching for the missing items now. I'll update once I know if they found them, and if they don't find them, whether they compensate me. Extremely frustrating. Based on other reviews from people who've had problems, I'm not holding my breath. Take the advice and go elsewhere."
4.0,0.2785,"So simple!! They came to pick up my laundry in the two hour time frame that I have requested in the App. A day later a nice guy delivered my laundry all clean, with a fantastic fresh smell and a cool 'Cleanly' laundry bag!! Defiantly recommended!"

5.0,0.1993,"Have mixed feelings about Cleanly. No complaints about the pick up and delivery service - it is prompt and professional, but I have had some issues with my laundry.  One time I had a pair of shorts stained.  They rectified this by offering complimentary dry cleaning, which was inconvenient but fine.  Another issue I had was with them using scented detergent when I specifically asked for unscented.  They offered to pick it up and wash it again for free...again inconvenient. I've also had three or four times where I've received other people's clothing in my laundry.  I haven't had any issues with my own clothing missing (that I know of) but it is concerning that I continue to receive other people's clothes in my order...three stars only because the dry cleaning service they have is perfect but laundry could use some significant improvements."
1.0,0.2467,"NIGHTMARE EXPERIENCE. I work long hours and gave them nearly all my clothes because I hadn't had a chance to do laundry in awhile. My roommate gets back the delivery as says we're missing the sheet for my bed. That sucks enough but I get home and realize we're missing ALL OF MY CLOTHES. They gave me a bag full of someone else's clothes, but the scariest part is there were three items that were mine in the bag, which makes it seem like it's not just a matter of delivering the wrong bag. The worst part is that we notified them ASAP and got back a bland ""I'm sorry to hear about the issue with your laundry"" and a request that we describe in detail everything that's missing. I can give descriptions of some of the items but it's literally ALL OF MY CLOTHES, but I try my best anyhow. Their customer service rep responds by saying "" As I mentioned, there is a 20-day period to allow us to do the best search possible."" WTF?! What am I supposed to do without all of my clothes? And they haven't said anything about a refund or reimbursement."
2.0,0.2264,"Was super excited to try Cleanly, but unfortunately that was not possible.  I was sent a text message letting me know that my laundry pick up time was approaching between 8:30-9:30.  They even had a picture of the guy who was going to pick up my laundry, but, he never came.  I called at 10:00 and it went strait to voicemail.  At 10:15 I received a call from cleanly and cancelled the order.  Completely disorganized. I see why other poor reviews make comments about them growing too fast."

In my bag I included a blanket, which wasn't very big or thick and could have easily gone into a load with other stuff.  I was charged SIXTEEN DOLLARS additional- $40 for 18 pounds of laundry.  Granted, after double checking, I notice they do include this on the app, but that's insane!  I know this place is expensive and more of a luxury, but the price is so incredibly high for what you're getting, and not worth getting laundry delivery.  Would not use again..."
1.0,0.218,"Started off seeming lovely, ended up being a shabby service, poor customer service. They should be spending the money on washing and folding and returning the correct items to the correct customer rather than on expensive laundry bags and promotional brownies. The ""concierge"" arrived at my door with a promotional brownie and a cool looking laundry bag for me to reuse on future orders. They asked how I wanted things folded, scented, bleached, and options for drop off and pick up were flexible. Then my orders began being returned to me in worse and worse condition. Things were missing. Things were not folded. Items NOT BELONGING TO ME were delivered in my bag. They are not the personalized service they originally claimed to be. They ship your laundry out to a huge facility that loses your stuff and which cannot accommodate any special requests. By ""special"" I mean folding. I wrote to them, exasperated, asking if my towels and napkins can be folded individually rather than simply stacked stop one another and then bundled into one wrinkled fold. This is the reply: ""Our vendors are processing thousands of pieces a day and cannot accommodate specific folding techniques at this time. Unfortunately, we cannot process a refund for you for this matter. I also sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Please let me know if you have any further questions."" Wash and fold means wash AND fold. And returning ones own possessions should be a given. It's pretty basic."
4.0,0.2222,"Just easy and great from start to finish! Especially like the dry cleaning option - conveniently timed and a quick turnaround. Love that I can do pick up's and deliveries later than usual work hours, which means that I never have to give it a second thought...plus the app design is pretty."
4.0,0.2368,Laundry is probably my least favorite activity...ever. Cleanly allows me to simply drop off my clothes with my doorman and pick it up when I'm done.

0.0,0.2268,"After having using Cleanly for several months, I've finally had enough. Not once have I had a pleasant experience, but I continued to utilize their service as a result of my own laziness and some coupons I received. I've had multiple items lost, which as previous reviews have indicated, takes them a full week to search--and never once have I had them found. While they claim to return orders within 24-48 hours, I've had orders returned to me in 72+ hours--with no explanation and a measly $5 off my next order coupon. Not only that, their prices are outrageous for the quality. My clothes come back feeling brittle, usually extremely wrinkled, and lackluster--almost like they've aged a year. However, my recent order will be my last as my previously white towel came back blue with two large blue ink stains on them. The amount of problems I've had with every single order I've place with them is completely unacceptable, and honestly not worth the ""convenience"" of their service. I'd rather waste 3 hours at a laundromat then use Cleanly again! Avoid!"

Same person delivered the laundry and carried it all the way upstairs and was so nice. They placed my nice shirts and pants on hangers and didn't dry them which was really considerate! Such good treatment of my clothes which is really appreciated. Oh and they give you a really nice laundry bag and garment bag! Seriously so easy and great service!!

4.0,0.2101,"Having been a customer of another laundry delivery company (that made service promises they couldn't keep) I was skeptical about the competition... I downloaded the app and was immediately impressed. It has a clean (forgive the pun) design and is very easy to use. The options are clear and booking a pickup delivery time is easy enough. The best thing is, they have an email support system and TELEPHONE NUMBER to call if you need to talk to a real human being. I even made contact with the CEO who asked me for constructive feedback based on other experiences I had had with competitors in the same market. Wonderfully responsive customer service, clothes are clean, fresh, picked up and delivered on time. No hidden fees, what you pay is what you pay. This service helps to free up my time to be more productive in other areas and costs a little bit more than doing it myself. No brainer. Great job guys!!"
4.0,0.2306,"My schedule makes it difficult to carve out the time to travel to the laundromat/dry cleaner's, and have had a few problems with different services in my neighborhood, so Cleanly is a lifesaver.  I love the app's interface and the ability to schedule pickup and drop off in advance, and trust that the company is actually going to make the window.  However, what I feel really distinguishes the company is the small touches - for example, I had a women's button-down shirt in the wash and fold and it was hung up instead of getting folded with the rest of my laundry.  Great experience and service!"
0.0,0.2431,"I have been using this service for nearly 6 months and it has been amazing - clean clothes with the convenience of a short window for delivery and pickup and next day service.  The staff is always courteous, professional and on time.  My instructions are always followed and my clothes come back clean and well folded and organized.  Not living in a doorman building finding a service like this that is reliable was truly an amazing time saver for this mother of 2 - I would highly recommend the service to anyone as I have been in the city for 9 years and unfortunately have had bad experiences sending my clothes out from losing items to not well cleaned clothes - it has been such a relief and time saver to find this service.  The app is very easy to use too!"
