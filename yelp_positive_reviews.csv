At first I was very worried of what would happen because I have always gone to the laundromat... well,1) this saves so much time!2) everything was folded so nice!3) everything felt super soft!4) everything never looked so good!The pricing was very reasonable. Why would other people complain about the price when your paying for convenience?This was my first time using it and I can't wait to send my laundry again in another week!It saves you sitting in the laundry for 2 hours and also saves money on detergent and it's delivered straight to your door!Download the app everyone! UPDATED REVIEW****Since my last review I have ordered it 3 times and they are still great! One day they picked this up at 8pm and it was back folded and clean in my hand at 8am the next day and I had a big heavy bag!Everyone should use this service! I no longer have to wait at the laundromat or even spend on detergent!"
5.0,0.161,"I've used them for a few years now. We have had our ups and downs.However starring 2019, What I have noticed is 1) The price point has gone up. Now its currently 1.60 a lbs, rather steep2) The minimum clean is 10 lbs3) They also offer alteration services nowBut along with the price increases, QUALITY has gone UPClothes are cleanerWhites are whiteMore appointment times availableWhats not to like?. If you like clean clothes that are cared for, on time deliveries and in general good service you should give them a try. I might give the dry cleaning services another shot. ( previously awful)"
1.0,0.254,"This app is great. I can schedule easily, if it's midnight and I realize I need to have my laundry done, I don't have to wait until the next morning to call and schedule--I just open the app. I have lived in NYC since 1998, and laundry is a constant hassle. This makes it so easy. And having early morning and later evening hours for drop off and pick-up works so well for my busy schedule. I don't have a doorman, so this is especially important for me. They sort lights and colors. When the laundry comes back folded- it's grouped by type. All my T-shirts are together, all my underwear and socks are together- and so on. That makes putting the clothes away all the more simple. I haaate doing laundry, and I hate shlepping big bags of laundry around the street to & from the laundry. It's kind of pricey. I pay it because the convenience is worth it to me and the service is good."
7.0,0.1403,"I've never had an issue with this company. I went from living in a place where I could do laundry in the building to living in a pre-war, non-laundry walk-up complex. I've tried places in the neighborhood and my laundry has returned to me soiled. I highly recommend Cleanly as the time frames match what I select, the person picking up my articles has always been friendly, and the customer service is great."
3.0,0.1884,"I've had good experiences with pickup and dropoff. Available times are typically convenient, even with less than 12 hours notice. With a variety of items (bedding, blankets, duvet covers, jeans, etc), I've received everything back fresh, folded, and even sorted. Pricing is about on par with other, similar services in the city. That being said, dry-clean prices are out of control. I'd recommend taking those items elsewhere.My only issues have been with customer service - when you need to reach out, responses can take longer than I think is appropriate given the nature of the service."
7.0,0.1326,They fulfilled every aspect of the services advertised. And did it very wellWe're impressed and will use them regularly
7.0,0.2056,"I've used Cleanly for more than a year and had mostly good experiences.  I've not had any issues with wash & fold and laundered shirts; no missing or damaged items during that time.  The only hiccup was the wrong laundry bag being returned but customer service was quick to resolve the issue.  App is pretty good but can be buggy on occasion.If there are issues, it is usually with pickup and delivery.  Scheduling pick ups, in particular, can be difficult if you don't plan a few days ahead as many morning time slots seems to book up fast, especially towards the end of the week.  They also recently reduced the number of pick up windows in the AM; previously you could pretty much select any hour between 630am to 10am.  Now, you can only choose between 630am and 730am or 730am and 930am.  2 hours is a large chunk of time to wait without knowing when they might arrive.  Deliveries are occasionally plagued with late drop offs but this seems less frequent recently.  All in all the convenience has outweighed any of the issues."
1.0,0.1574,"Cleanly is great - it is so much easier to have your laundry picked up and delivered door to door than lugging it a few blocks and spending hours in a laundromat every time you need to wash your sheets.I think their pricing for blankets and duvet covers is a little high, but their wash and fold pricing is reasonable and consistent with what you might pay at a regular laundromat. Cleanly has made y life a lot easier overall!"
1.0,0.2169,"App has a great UI and is very straight forward on ease of use. The laundry itself has come back in good condition, no complaints there. It's saved me a lot of time as even though I have a washer/dryer combo it takes forever to run a single load. My only issue is sometimes pickup has come 10-30 minutes earlier than the time listed and I may not be home which they seem to get annoyed with which is also annoying on my end as sometimes the windows selected are already 90 minutes wide.But overall though it's an easy to use service which saves me time, costs a fraction of that time I would have spent on laundry and has enabled me to do all my laundry in a quick turnaround. I travel a lot for work and the last thing I want to do when I get home from a trip is laundry, especially when I have to leave again in 48 hours."
0.0,0.1373,"I will probably never do my own laundry again! Cleanly is fantastic - prompt with pick ups and drop offs, items are nicely folded and arrive clean, fresh and smelling great. I am so pleased to get time back for other tasks!"
6.0,0.1856,"I have used Cleanly three times -- to wash clothes, bedding, and bath linens. I was very impressed with the high quality of service I received:- Neatly folded and organized laundry in the bag.- Couriers were polite and on time.- Quick turn around time.- Great flexibility for morning/night pickup and drop off times!- Love the option to be able to reschedule!If you are planning to move or go on a trip, get your laundry done with Cleanly! It makes packing so much easier! And your clothes will smell amazing."
0.0,0.23,"**Update** Still love the service and convenience, I use this service for work and for billing purposes I need to have the main address listed on the account, however the pick up and drop off locations would be our loading dock directly behind our building. Updates to the app need to be made to be able to specify billing address and pick up/drop off address. The couriers don't always read the comments like you think they should, but besides that minor flaw i still rate the service and convenience with 5 stars!!"
1.0,0.1214,I live on the sixth floor of a walk up with no in unit laundry so it's a big help to have cleanly. The dry cleaning haas been good and they got out all stains. Pretty consistent with pickup
5.0,0.1492,"Cleanly is a really nice laundry service! The app is easy to use. My clothes always come back smelling nicely and folded neatly. I wish the tipping situation was a bit clearer. As of now, you wait to tip until after the carrier picks up and drops off your clothes. Other than that, I'm very pleased!"
8.0,0.1464,"We have no laundry in our building and the closest laundromat is too far away, unfortunately. We always receive excellent service with Cleanly. Our laundry always smells so good and is folded perfectly, so amazing to not have the hassle. Also, 90% of the time its sorted for us, which makes life a lot easier with our busy schedules. The app is so convenient and the staff is always very nice and kind. We are cleanly reserve members and it really pays off! Cleanly is worth every cent!"
3.0,0.1494,Love cleanly support service team and the delivery team!!! My clothes smell amazing all the time!!!
4.0,0.1514,"I've really enjoyed my experience with Cleanly thus far - I've never been one to have my laundry sent out (been doing it myself since I was a kid) - but my roommate and I moved into a building that was supposed to have laundry in building and two months in they still have not installed - and since we didn't scope out neighborhood laundromats because of this - we turned to Cleanly! It is very easy to use and schedule pickup/dropoff, and i love how the clothes come back better folded than I could ever do myself, and they sort everything for you! I find it pretty affordable with all the promo codes & discounts they offer, but I've only done the basic wash & fold. Drivers are always super friendly! Will keep using until I have my own W/D :)"
6.0,0.1348,Much easier than traditional cleaners. Time is a commodity that I can't affront to waste and Cleanly helps me from going down the street with heavy bags.
5.0,0.1585,"I've been using Cleanly for 3 years (the whole time I've lived in NYC), and they have done a great job. They were late just once that I can remember, and they more than made up for it with a credit to my account. My clothes always come back clean and folded. It beats doing laundry yourself!"
6.0,0.157,"Cleanly is great. I love the quality laundry bags, and usually the service is on time and they make it right if something is ever late. The prices are a little higher than local neighborhood spots, but the convenience is worth it! It's nice to have someone schlepp all of my laundry and dry cleaning. One less thing to waste time on!"
4.0,0.1783,We are using it around once or twice per month and are quite happy so far with reasonable pricing for good service.Cleanly is great especially with a part time doorman as you can still define the 1h time slot to pick up and drop off.So far Cleanly always made it in time before the doorman left (earliest evening slot is 7-8 and doorman leaves at 8; wish there was an earlier slot just to have some buffer).Overall highly recommended.
2.0,0.1346,"I've used Cleanly for wash & fold in the past year and have had consistently good experiences. Despite a couple of small hiccups here and there, their customer service is responsive and my clothes always come back soft, perfectly folded, and smelling so nice."
6.0,0.1658,"Have always had a great experience with Cleanly each time I've used it! If there was any type of delay, the concierge would provide a credit for the next time. Very responsive."
6.0,0.1443,"For a while I felt like sending my laundry away was a ""splurge"", but honestly every time I get the bill, it's always quite fair for how much stuff I send out. Fair pricing and the ease of an app makes this service my go-to for quick and easy, stress-free, thought-free laundry. They've never lost anything or ruined the colors like some of the laundromats that I've dropped off at, which makes it a step above any other manual service I've tried. Even if you don't stick with it I highly recommend trying this service out, they give you some great deals just for trying them out!!!"
3.0,0.1589,"This is an excellent service. They've always been respectful of time and willing to reschedule. Service is limited on holidays but in general very accessible. Prices are fair for the cleanliness. I like how easy to use the app is and how clear the pricing is. There are a couple of bugs here and there with rescheduling but they seem to be fixing stuff regularly. Overall, I made the switch to cleanly a year ago and I'm very happy."
8.0,0.1847,"Cleanly makes my busy life so much simpler. I started using them when they first opened a few years ago. Since their business has grown so quickly their has started to be some inconsistencies but their customer service is phenomenal and keeps me coming back. Also loving the new benefits they have been adding. A few months ago they sent out a survey and they really took it to heart and seem to have implemented a lot of the feedback. Shout out to cleanly for always keeping me ""so fresh and so clean"""
7.0,0.2061,"I've used Cleanly 3 times so far and I haven't run into any issues. The tones for pickup/drop off are convenient even if I order for pickup with less than 12hrs notice. My clothes always return perfectly folded in bags. They always smell fresh as well. I can't attest for any hang dry or dry clean things as I have only done regular laundry. My only issues: On my first order it says you will receive 3 Cleanly bags for dry cleaning, hang dry and regular wash although I only received 1 unmarked black laundry bag (which is fine because that's all I need but still). My only other issue is that usually in the morning for pickup each time they have been late. I always get a text saying ""Traffic is bad, your cleanly concierge is running 45 minutes late"". I've had about 50/50 with late or on time pickup/drop off. All in all I would recommend!"
5.0,0.1687,"I had a great experience with Cleanly. It is the first time I tried dry cleaning delivery service and I must say i was very satisfied with their service. Their app is easy to use and navigate and neatly designed. I just left my clothes with my front desk staff and the clothes were picked up and delivered within promised time frames. All my clothes were nicely cleaned and pressed when I received them back. The price is very reasonable especially considering it's a dry cleaning delivery service in the city (I got 20% off for my first order, and I don't think there was delivery fee at all, though I imagine I will be charged with delivery fees in future orders). I saw some negative reviews here about losing items and not being able to get reimbursed which sounds horrible. But fortunately it didn't happen with me so I think I would still use them in the future based on my personal experience. Definitely recommend"
6.0,0.1365,Excellent service - on time and my clothes came back perfectly washed and folded. Smelt great unlike some other services. Had major issues with Fly Cleaner and I'm so much happier with the customer service and overall experience. Would recommend to anyone.
6.0,0.138,"I have used cleanly now about 3 times. They are super convenient to use. It's only about $8 more to use their service than to take my laundry down the street -wash it, dry it, fold it myself. It's a major time saver and am glad to use their services any time."
5.0,0.1481,"Delivery in time, easy system through the app, affordable prices, not a 5 star pressing quality."
3.0,0.2103,Was good until they lost my clothes. All seven items sent for hang dry a month ago missing and haven't heard back from themUpdate cleanly reimbursed me for the missing items
6.0,0.1429,AH - the best service! The communication is fantastic & they do such a great job! Clothes come back well organized and clean! I would recommend this to anyone in the NYC Area!
6.0,0.1575,"I love Cleanly! I had some issues with them being late or having limited availability earlier this year (something to do with drivers?), but seems like kinks have been worked out and now my laundry is always picked up and dropped off on time. I can get it in 24 hrs if I want! Drivers are friendly and helpful. They even fold my underwear! It's great to have a reliable laundry service so I don't have to waste time at the laundromat. Thanks Cleanly!"
0.0,0.1362,"Good service, app easy and simple to use, with prime annual membership no cancellation fees, only con: less flexible when something gets damaged"
1.0,0.2111,Cleanly helps make laundry easy and convenient for a busy lifestyle! I love that they can pick up and drop off really early in the mornings before I head to work. Also they include dry cleaning with my laundry so it is truly a double whammy for making my life easier. They will give little discount codes here and there which also helps when I have a ton of stuff to clean and it can get pricy.
5.0,0.1924,"I have now used the service 3 times and have been VERY pleased the valets are incredibly nice (even walking up to a 5th Floor walk up..), consistently on time, and my clothes have always come back perfect. I have not had any items missing that I have noticed. The app is so amazing and I like that it shows where my valet is and when to expect them.There was one time we had a shirt dry cleaned and after that became very brittle but I am not sure if that anything to do with Cleanly's service.I will definitely continue using this service, until I am shown any reason not too."
2.0,0.172,"Seriously amazing service. Easy app, also on time for pick up and drop off, friendly valets.The separate whites and colors at no fee and my clothes are never damaged. They also have convenient bags for hang dry, laundry and dry cleaning. All around makes my life so much easier."
4.0,0.3612,"I love first-class service. I especially love first-class service when it includes delivery/pickup straight to/from my door, and I love it even more when the result of the service is top-notch and first-class in itself. I heard about Cleanly thanks to the power of social media ads and tried it on a whim. I was going away for the weekend and didn't have time to do my laundry beforehand. Cleanly came to the rescue; they picked up my bag of wash-and-fold laundry and delivered the clean laundry two days later, at my request.I'm a graphic designer who works primarily in packaging design so I have deep respect when it comes to the wrapping and packaging of things. That being said, I've never seen anything packaged as pristinely as my folded clothing post-Cleanly. The laundry was folded in one perfectly neat stack and sealed tightly in plastic, then wrapped inside a thick, durable Cleanly laundry bag. In one compact stack the laundry was separated by clothing category, sort of how you might imagine a laundry layer cake if a laundry layer cake was a thing: sweatpants, t-shirts, workout clothing, yoga pants, sports bras, undergarments, socks. I put the perfect stack on my bed and took a photo to sent to all my friends who appreciate perfect things.Since that one fateful whim, I've sent out my laundry for Cleanly's wash-and-fold service a few times before going away on trips. I've also used their dry cleaning service and my clothing has returned as fresh as can be.The customer service at Cleanly is also first-class: you receive text messages when your order is picked up and underway, as well as notifications when it's dropped off. If Cleanly has any questions, they send a quick text to confirm things with you before proceeding. Also, the Cleanly app is A++, gorgeously designed, easy to navigate, et al. Life is too short to stay up until 1am doing your own laundry when you have a train to catch early the next morning for a 3-day trip; instead, catch some Zzz's and send your laundry out to Cleanly. You'll have sweet, sweet detergent dreams."
4.0,0.1637,"What a LIFESAVER! My building does not have laundry in it and the laundromat is juuuust far enough to make it incredibly undesirable. I used a friend's referral code for Cleanly and have been hooked! I have since used it probably upwards of 6 or 7 times. They do a great job with wash and fold, laundry service etc.I've only had them run late one time and I was very clearly communicated with and the delivery fee was refunded right away.The only reason this is not a 5 star service for me is because it is definitely not cheap. I've had bags of laundry that were less than half full and it will cost me $30 - yikes!Overall, a great service and I will continue to use for small loads :)"
7.0,0.1652,"I've been using Cleanly for a few months now, and it's been a phenomenal addition to my life. The clothes are always folded crisply, and with attention to detail - I love how the socks and other small items are separated from the rest of the laundry. The timeliness is usually on point as well. I've only had one or two issues with tardiness; one was only 10-15 minutes late, and another was 30 minutes late, but the delivery person seemed to have a physical ailment so I didn't have an issue. When I've needed rush delivery, that has been solid as well.Someone else mentioned that the fabric softener smell isn't as pronounced. That's true, but I never would have realized that if I hadn't read it, so I didn't allow that to detract from my score. There have also been a couple times where it's been more expensive than I assumed it would be, but not obscenely so. It's not like I weigh the laundry myself before sending it off, and the results are usually good enough for me not to care. I've been considering using the VIP, and I've been considering using the dry cleaning option. But I've also been considering taking my own control and doing my own laundry, haha. Still a great service though, and one I'm comfortable recommending."
1.0,0.2073,"Cleanly saves my life week after week! I hadn't seen the best reviews so I was hesitate---but I am so glad I tried it anyway. Doing laundry is impossible when you're a single, busy professional in NYC. I don't have laundry in my building, nor do I have the time to go sit at a laundromat for hours. To be honest, I don't even have time to simply take my laundry to drop it off. I love Cleanly because it is SO EASY to place an order for pick up and drop off service on the app. You can even get same-day. I give them almost 2-3 LARGE bags at a time and the guys pick it up and drop it off like champs! They bring it back perfectly folded or hanging and I've  never had an issue. LOVE this service---and that says a lot for New York."
7.0,0.1643,"Consistently a good experience overall. Just a few delivery miscommunications (i.e. wrong buzzer, showed up early, etc.) but otherwise no complaints. Their support team promptly responds to all issues/requests, which is appreciated. If they used my preferred detergent and fabric softener, I'd be in heaven!"
3.0,0.1426,"I would definitely use this service again. The communication was great! I recieved texts when to gather my items, when my items would be picked up/dropped off and if they were running behind. My clothes came back accounted for, freshly laundered and folded."
1.0,0.1967,"I've always had a great experience with Cleanly and prefer them over every other service and my local laundry place. The app makes it so easy to place my order and schedule a pickup/drop off. Sometimes when I'm working late I need to switch my times, and I appreciate how flexible they are. Their valets are really nice, and always come to the door with a smile. Since Cleanly's been around I haven't had to rush home before the laundry place closes, which makes all the difference because now I don't have to worry. I've always got all my items back, and they feel and smell great. I don't see myself going back to any other laundry service, which is a big statement. All my friends use them too and they don't have any issues whatsoever. Thanks Cleanly. Keep up the great work!"
3.0,0.1459,"Always an enjoyable experience with cleanly:) I have never experienced any serious problems with clothing. It always comes back smelling nice and fresh. Sometimes the pick up/ drop off is late due to traffic, but only by a few minutes in my experience."

4.0,0.1496,"Cleanly is perfect for NYC! I use cleanly for sheets and towels because they never seem to dry in one cycles when using my buildings machines. I've used other similar services before but I that appreciate cleanly has a designated on call customer care service who is very helpful. Sometimes their app is not as user friendly as I'd ideally like, otherwise I'd give them 5 stars instead of 4."
0.0,0.195,"If you don't have machines in your apartment or building, doing laundry in the city is a complete pain. So, Cleanly has been a godsend. They have pick-up/drop-off times early in the AM so it's not hard to schedule for before leaving for work. Their app is very easy to use and you can edit your pickups/drop-offs right up to your appointment without penalties. Their prices seem competitive with other drop-off services near me and they often have coupons and discounts that make it even more affordable.While I know I should just suck it up and drag my clothes to the laundromat down the block, Cleanly's convenience and customer service have made it all the more worth it. I highly recommend."
4.0,0.1458,"Cleanly is fabulous! They are a simple and easy to use and I think pretty affordable, although I have nothing to compare it to. What I love most about Cleanly is they have a text message service which makes it simple to get updates and get into contact with them. They have also reached out to me for clarification through text.Their pickup/delivery associates are always on time and actually on the early side and I am never waiting. They tell you as soon as they're on their way so you aren't caught off guard. They also climb up my 4th floor walk up as well. My clothes always smell great and I love that they have several cleaning/drying options, hang dry is specifically great for my delicates. They are a very thorough service and the receipt even lists the brands for each item.I am trying to Cleanly Reserve service, I saved a lot of money when using it and need to determine if it's worth it for the annual membership.Great stuff!"
5.0,0.181,"Only reason I give it 4 stars is because I referred a friend and they did not have the best experience, which really bums me out.On the other hand, the other 4 stars are based on MY experience the last 8 months. The first time they picked up my laundry they gave me three bags (wash and fold, dry clean, and hang dry). The app is super easy and the prices in my opinion are cheaper than some of my laundromats around my place in EV.You have the options for washing preferences and everything has been clean and fresh! My only recommendation is if you do the hang dry option, make sure you're home to receive it ASAP and take it out to further dry. It gets delivered semi dry so if you don't air it out it'll get that mildewy smell which is NOT OK!Otherwise my experience has been great with Cleanly and prefer it over other laundry services"
2.0,0.146,"Gave Cleanly another shot because short of going to the Laundromat myself, I don't have many other options. So, I'd like to update my review to mention that I DO feel as though I can trust Cleanly to handle my wash & fold needs and I would recommend them for that.  They are consistently on time, if not slightly early and the convenience of not having to lug my clothes around & spend time at the Laundromat is beyond worth it for me-- using the app is SO easy.  My wash & fold comes back smelling nice & usually folded without wrinkles."
4.0,0.1615,"I tried Cleanly for the first time after a friend recommended it. I decided to try it out for drycleaning my coats and dresses. The app was really easy to use, and you can specify where stains are/ where they need to pay special attention with a photo/ description. Pick up and delivery were easy to schedule, and I just left the items with my doorman for pickup. There are text messages that tell you where your items are, and customer service was great! I had to contact them about a billing issue and got a response within a day. Would recommend!"
3.0,0.1538,"really have nothing bad to say about cleanly! I've only used the regular laundry (haven't done blankets or duvets), but that service has been stellar for the year-ish i've been using them consistently. They have been on time almost always, or if late, extremely communicative."
3.0,0.1866,Going from a unit with a stacking washer dryer to a building without laundry even in building was a frustrating transition. My husband and I are very glad we found cleanly. Reasonably priced for laundry pick up and drop off with 24 your turn around and the annual reserve account has paid for itself with discounts etc. any items lost (which can happen with any kind of laundry service) the team has been great to credit us for.
5.0,0.1462,"Amazing laundry service! Very easy to use app and great time windows for drop off/delivery. Sent off a large load of laundry 7AM one morning and got back around same time the next. Highly recommend, very efficient and clothes were perfectly folded and smelled so nice! I will definitely continue to use this service!"
3.0,0.1486,"Cleanly is a great service for the busy professional. The advantages are as follows:1. I feel the prices are very reasonable - but they have inched up (on the shirts I guess).2. It is very convenient, especially in the winters3. Customer service is extremely responsive. Sometimes the problem is beyond their control but they still try to help.There are some glitches with the app. I am unable to order Rush Delivery at times. That will get sorted over a period of time I hope. I also hope they have a better loyalty/reserve program. They should better reward loyal/sticky customers."
1.0,0.173,"I absolutely love Cleanly. It's extremely efficient and convenient to use. The app is super easy to use and it makes laundry day not a pain. Living in NYC, doing laundry is a bit of a task. So it's nice to use the app, and have someone come pick up your laundry and then deliver it the next day. I once had a delivery guy cancel and I got a notification that I cancelled my order, so I was charged. When I reached out to customer service they were extremely helpful and reversed the fee. They responded in a timely manner, and I was able to create another order. To be honest, it is pretty pricey to use. I usually wait until they have a promotion so I can use them."
6.0,0.1481,"Excellent service! Always on time and reasonable prices!! If you encounter any problems, which I doubt, they are super quick to answer and their will help you until everything is resolved!! Would recommend 100%"
4.0,0.1532,"Not sure I'll ever do my own laundry again. Both the pickup and drop-off individuals were very kind and well within the hour window. I had originally rushed home thinking that they would arrive without notice, but the app actually sends you a notification when they're en route. Everything was super clean and expertly folded. Would recommend to everyone, and have already convinced all of my friends."
5.0,0.204,"I'm really impressed! I recently broke a bone in my foot and am not able to walk to the laundromat that I normally use. The drivers on pickup and delivery both walked up to my sixth floor apartment to move my laundry, really kind of them. My clothes were on time, smelled fresh, and folded sharply. I would definitely use them again."
7.0,0.1465,Always arrives and delivers in the window you requested. Clothes are folded neatly and the point people are vey friendly. Great service if time is not on your side when it comes to getting laundry done.
4.0,0.1597,"I am a reserve member and use cleanly about 2x a month. It's incredibly convenient and the delivery staff is always on time. I've also completed gotten my money's worth with my Reserve membership because I wash my clothes in small batches and always have 6-10 items for hang dry. Generally, my clothes are washed well and folded with no issues and in the few instances, the cleanly team is amazing about following up and making it right."

7.0,0.2222,"I've been using Cleanly for 6 months now - I've had a good experience with them.Being able to schedule and track everything is fantastic and I don't have to worry about when my local cleaner opens and closes. The deliver people are always nice and usually show up within 5-10 minutes of the beginning of the window you selected for delivery.Having the option to select warm / cold + dry temperature is really nice - I haven't had any clothes come back damaged. There have been two occasions were my items weren't perfect - once I received clothes that felt slick, I believe that they may have used softener even though I selected to not have it applied, and another time my clothes were folded but had a lot of wrinkles - both things I could live with - otherwise every other time has met my expectations.The only thing missing from the service is an Android application, it's a little annoying to have to use the mobile site to manage an order and I haven't been able to 'track' my delivery person via Android yet.Overall I would recommend Cleanly to anyone who is wanting a convenient service to have their clothes cleaned and is willing to pay a little extra for that luxury."

I had an absolutely horrifying experience with Fly Cleaners which made me make the switch and I am happy I did.They are fast, on time, and my clothes come perfectly folded smelling fresh. I also appreciate that you can set your laundry preferences so that athletic items and whites don't come back ruined. Definitely recommend if you are busy and don't have time for small things like grocies, laundry, cleaning etc."

2.0,0.3011,"I've been using Cleanly for 6 months now.Pros-Nice valets-On-time pick-up and drop-off-Nicely folded clothes and they do hang dry my more delicate items for a small fee-Nice free hang dry bag and laundry bag-Feel like it's more hygenic than leaving my laundry bag in a huge pile at the local laundromat as they double bag my clothes with plastic and it goes in a car, but who the heck knows-Free delivery for larger loadsCons-At $1.50 per pound it's....well I don't have to leave my apartment so no complaints.-Sometimes inconsistent...I've asked for no fabric softener and been disappointed to find that my clothes were full of it and stunk up my whole house with that fragrant odor.  -Sometimes the plastic bag will have a hole in it....I think it happens when the valet carries it and tries to grip it. This has happened three times but it probably happens when they take it upstairs, because it's always in the same spot. I told Cleanly about it once and they offered to rewash the clothes.-Personally, I find the price to wash bigger blankets and larger items to be too steep.Overall I like the service. I'll be inside this coming winter and not hauling a bag to the laundromat in the snow. Ain't nobody got time for that."

They have cleaned up the toughest stains on my clothes and bedding. Maybe once they did not arrive in time, but I use them on a regular basis at least 2 to 4 times per month and they are on time 95 percent of the time.  When there are snow storms or any kind of delay - they notify me.  I really appreciate their good sense and how they treat their customers.  The customer service team is super responsive and very helpful.  I would recommend this laundry service to anyone."

I was nervous about including towels in my order, so the valet had me put them separate so they got washed separately. When I got my order after work, my hang dry items were MIA. I called Cleanly, and they resolved my issue within 15 minutes (turns out I had the items all along, they were just hanging in the buildings closet). I'll absolutely use them again.My only complaint is that I wish they had more details on their website for first time users, but if you get a helpful valet, they'll be able to answer any questions at your initial pickup."

3.0,0.2016,"I have a love-hate (maybe not hate, but definitley like-dislike) relationship with Cleanly. I have used them since they first came to Harlem and I never had any problems until this last year.For the most part I get my laundry picked up and dropped off several times a month and it is a seamless, hassle-free transaction. It is when I get back laundry and dry cleaning that is not mine, or when they misplace an item and ask if I have a picture to help them find it, or when an item or two come back with oil stains/completely ruined. All previous accounts of past orders, BUT I can give Cleanly a *chest bump* for always handing the situation and getting whatever it is wrong taken care of in a timely manner. Customer service is on point and always email me back wicked fast. I will say that I prefer Cleanly over other laundry services in the city. Their Reserve (premium membership) is worth every penny and would highly recommending joining. Despite any problems or ruined items (very few) they always make it right. End of review. Use Cleanly! *The feedback above is to be used as constructive criticism and not negative."
1.0,0.1655,"Cleanly has been a lifesaver since moving to NYC from Florida.  I wasn't used to apartments not having in-unit washers and dryers.  Without a car or the time to wait around at a laundromat for hours, I've basically tried to avoid doing laundry as much as possible. Enter Cleanly, which was recommended to me by my roommate. The app is so easy to use and I love that I can customize the way my laundry is done.  In around 24 hours, I can have a month's worth of laundry cleaned, folded, and hung to dry at a super reasonable price, all without leaving the comfort of my third floor apartment. Thank you, Cleanly, for making my transition to the city infinitely easier to handle."

I'd give them five stars if the price was a little lower. It's a great service, but in the world of you get what you pay for, that level of service is kind of expected. Also, ability to track the pick-up/delivery via gps is amazing and very much a need in 2017 here."

The thing I love the most it's how the clothes smell soooooo clean and fresh, when I first did it myself in the corner laundry it would smell like burnt and I would hate it more than anything.

2.0,0.2747,"I've used Cleanly three times now and it's definitely my favorite pick up/delivery laundry service in NYC. The app is sleek and easy to use, with many options to chose from in terms of laundry preference. I love that they have three separate bags to give you so you can choose to wash and fold, wash and hang dry or dry clean. So great, as I have MANY items that need to hang dry. I love the option to drop off with doorman, since I do live in a doorman building. Makes it convenient and easy for me. As for the actual laundry, my clothes have always returned clean and smelling great. They also do a great job with folding.I only have a few complaints. In the app, I find that I need to re-enter my address every time in order to denote that I want to drop off my laundry with my doorman, otherwise I'm forced to schedule a pick up and drop off time. I also noticed that I haven't been getting the promised doorman dropoff discount on my receipts which is a little frustrating. Finally, I've never had any clothing lost, but I have received a sock that wasn't mine. No big deal for me there though. And as always, you have to pay the price! It's expensive, but no more so than every other wash and fold service I have tried.I would also love the option to clean my whites with Clorox II instead of bleach, but that's being very picky. :)"

5.0,0.2141,"I have truly enjoyed the services Cleanly has provided us!  I discovered them when I found an awesome apartment that didn't have laundry onsite.  I'm on the top (third) floor and my back won't allow me to lift two folks' worth of laundry up and down weekly (plus the nearest option blocks away).  The pick up/drop off people are pleasant and on time and the clothes come back clean, as expected.  I would give them a 5 star based on quality and reliability, but gave 4 for two reasons:  the cost is not modest and also, of late, there has been a two day lag from pick up to drop off (only a month ago it was next day service).  You sometimes have the option to pay even more for a rush, but no luck.  Would be great if they periodically gave coupons or perks for regulars!  Regardless, I highly recommend Cleanly!"

The laundry room in my building will be closed for a few months due to repairs so I did extensive research and picked Cleanly. They were great! They sent me a bunch of emails and texts regarding the whole process and did the pick up on time and the delivery even earlier! The personnel were very nice and helpful. The clothes smell clean! Overall, like I said, my experience has been nothing but perfection. I will definitively do my laundry again with Cleanly!!!"
2.0,0.1972,"This review is long, but if you want to know if you should use Cleanly...the answer is unequivocally, unquestionably, YES. After moving to New York a year ago (from the deep south) I could never get a handle on the arduous, painful, and equally necessary task of laundry. I went to a self service laundromat about 3 blocks (avenue blocks, mind you) away, and I saw how their wash and fold service worked...it grossed me out. So, I did my own laundry, in New York, for a year. About a month ago I was done. I couldn't keep it up, so I searched Yelp and Google for an answer...behold, Cleanly. I was highly skeptical at first, having never used a wash and fold service, not to mention the idea of a stranger up to his or her elbows in my unmentionables. Well, I quickly got over that. They provide you with a giant (think 50 pound drum, okay kidding) canvas bag for wash and fold, a hanging bag for dry cleaning, and another hanging bag for hang dry items.Best things about Cleanly:1. The app makes it SO easy to order a pickup2. You get to pick wash temps, detergent type, dryer temp etc.3. You get to set the time, and in my experience (5 orders now) they arrive in the first 15 minutes of the 1 hour time window. Every. Single. Time.4. The valets I've dealt with are really friendly, which, I mean who doesn't like that?5. MY CLOTHES SMELL AMAZING.6. I haven't had any thing lost7. Cleanly Reserve. Worth it. This gets rid of the $30 minimum and $4.99 delivery fee (still worth it), and you get up to 12 hang dry pieces for free? I believe it's 12. Don't quote me.I have told all my friends about this service. It has literally changed my life. Cannot say enough good things."
2.0,0.3224,"App and website are simple and easy, valets are on-time and professional, quality is always spot-on. Wash and fold and pressed shirts are a touch more expensive than your standard NYC laundromat ($1.50/lb for wash and fold and $3/shirt for pressing and hanging at time of writing this) but of course they actually come up to your apt door to pick it up and drop it off, which to me is worth the price.They're happy to your use existing laundry bags and when they return your pressed items they're all hung up nicely in a suit bag. They also let you specify preferences (both for a single order or your personal defaults) for things like water and dryer temp (which can be different for darks and lights!), detergent type, bleach or no bleach, etc., which is awesome. Getting back shrunken clothes from the laundromat is kind of a pet peeve of mine. Oh, and as far as I can tell they've never lost anything or accidentally put someone else's sock or t-shirt in my bag.Only small quibble is that pickup and delivery times are all in the morning before 10 or in the evening after about 5. I work from home so mid-day would be convenient. But I realize those windows are probably what work best for most people who actually leave their house for most of the day."

There is always a time slot available, often same day, for pickup when I forget to schedule to have my laundry picked up. Getting the items sent back the next day is so helpful as well. Saves me the time of having to go to the laundrymat and sit around. It's so simple to have them pick it up and take care of the time consuming task for you! The laundry always comes back smelling great and folded. We ended up signing up for Cleanly Reserve to save the extra money on minimum fees and hang dry fees. I love the texting feature as well, letting you know when your valet is on the way, etc. We've never had a valet be late for pick up, and often they are at the early side of the 1 hour window. Can't recommend enough!!"

Staff is super helpful and friendly. I've even had to contact customer service (by no fault of cleanly) and they were super helpful and followed through to the T. The pressed shirts come back impeccable but the most important thing is the folding. I'm convinced there are folding wizards tucked somewhere in a dank basement in Manhattan just going hard. The folding is a piece of art. They've folded round things into perfect squares and somehow everything, no matter what it is, is the exact same folded size as everything else. In terms of price, it's expensive compared to a laundromat but very reasonable for the pickup laundry market and totally worth it. Do it."
7.0,0.1533,"Amazing service, prompt delivery, and good work. Very pleased!

I wish they'd just iron it in the other direction. Otherwise, very pleased. Bit pricey, but for what you get and the speed at which you get it, its pretty damn good."

I found Cleanly via google and have been using them and the app for over a year now. They are always on time, extremely friendly and the customer service is fantastic. The one time I thought they had lost something they were quick to reply (""lost"" item ended up being tucked between two towels and not immediately visible). I've recommend this service to many friends and to you in turn. I even signed up for their Reserve Membership- worth every penny.  Couldn't ask for a better service in NYC. Thank you!"

Or make sure they have enough COINS (It's 2018???) to operate the machines? Or figure out how they even work sometimes? And who realistically can do all of this while trying to lug around 15 lbs. of laundry? It's just... THE WORST. Cleanly takes literally ALL of the headache out of laundry. They do the heavy lifting, the transporting, the cleaning, and even THE FOLDING. It's such a relief to have one less thing to worry about or spend time on, and it makes the cost very much worth it in my opinion. I spread this good word wherever I can and am so grateful to Cleanly for making my life EASIER!"

1.0,0.3656,"Good Morning Mr. Harari,Your company is absolutely amazing!!! NEW YORKWhen I had my assistant contract a cleaning company for my home in New York, Your company was selected for this very purpose: ""We built Cleanly to reflect our values of delightful service, simple design, and an obsession with quality. They drive everything we do""This morning my flight was cancelled from JFK to LA for the obvious reasons. Someone rang my doorbell and I answered it. Unbeknownst to me my laundry was arriving, I opened the door and one of you workers handed me my cleaned laundry in the frigid bleeding cold. I asked him WHO MADE YOU WORK IN THIS DANGEROUS WEATHER. He responded with not my employer but the need to keep the heat on in my house for my familyI respect this gentleman for his efforts in being dedicated to the company and his family and caring out the mission on both sides. I was not able to tip the gentleman because I had no cash. However, I was able to provide him a shovel and some salt to assist him with pushing his vehicle out of the snow where he was stuck. You have very dedicated staff!!! This weather is life threatening. I hope that you find a way to tip your workers for this dedicated sacrifice. It truly takes DEDICATED INDIVIUALS to put their life on the line for performing this type of job in this kind of weather where the Governor of the state declared a state of emergency. I hope this young man makes it back home safe to his family and I hope that this company thanks each and every soul that risked their life to work on today.Happy New YearRegards,Kendrick"

I'm leaving one star out because the one time I used for hang-dry, the shirts came back damp but I generally don't like to send laundry out for anything other than wash and fold, so for that... they get a thumbs up from me."
8.0,0.1878,"Just used this service for the first time because 1) I'm lazy and had a lot of laundry to do and 2) I like things I can pay for with an App.The Experience - I was going to give up within the first 30 minutes of downloading the app because it was buggy and couldn't detect my address/I couldn't enter my address. Since I wasn't doing anything productive the entire day, I decided to e-mail the Cleanly team. After a few exchanges, they manually added my address for me.Someone came by to pick up my clothes within the first 15 minutes of my 1 hour window. I like when people are on time! She was super friendly and placed all my wash and fold laundry into a huge purple bag. She handed me two other bags for future use, one for hang dry clothing and one for dry cleaning.The following day, my driver came nearer the end of the 1 hour window. I took my clothes up to my apartment and opened the bag. Everything is neatly folded and best part is that they don't roll pairs of socks into each other! They lay them out flat, just the way they should be so they don't get ruined. Next time I think I'll request fragrance free Tide on the app since the scent is a bit strong.Overall, the service is excellent. The pricing is a bit steep compared to my laundromat two blocks away, but I'll definitely take advantage of this whenever I feel lazy again."

3.0,0.3767,"*Update*Cleanly fully compensated me for my list items and all is resolved. I'd decided to do my own laundry from here on out but got extremely busy and used them in a pinch last week. All went very well. Pleased with my recent service.*******I had nothing but positive experiences with cleanly for two years. I used them at least twice a month and was always satisfied with the service. Unfortunately, my entire bag of laundry that was sent out on August 24th and was supposed to be returned on August 26th was lost. It was only sheets and towels, which, though expensive and annoying to replace, is better than losing an entire bag of clothing. I understand that things happen and once in two years is a pretty good record. However, the circumstances were strange, as the laundry was marked delivered, the apartment number was printed on the tag and I was at home, and no one buzzed my apt. They did not call to say they were unable to get in. Follow up has been horrible, to say the least. I had to basically stalk customer service with calls and emails and it was 24 hours before I got someone on the phone. Every time I needed an update, I had to track it down (and explain again the entire situation to a new person). I was sent photos of laundry they thought was mine (um, how many missing things are there??) and none of it even vaguely resembled the detailed list I gave of my items, which makes me feel like this situation has not been taken seriously. In addition, the ""search process"" has taken over two weeks. How much area is there to search?I have been told that I will be contacted for reimbursement of the $450 worth of sheets, towels, and duvet covers that were lost. I have heard nothing. I'm very disappointed as I've been a loyal cleanly customer for a long time."

I live in a 4 story walk up and laundry is a pain to bring up and down the stairs every time. Cleanly comes right to the door for pickup and delivery. They're also very good about following care instructions and all your clothes come back to you smelling fantastic. What I also like about the service is that there is that you can easily change your drop off and pickup time if you need to. For instance if you have spur of the moment plans that happen during a drop off or pick up, simply login to the app and switch it. It's super easy. I would recommend Cleanly to anyone who's looking to give themselves some more time and who lives in NYC where laundry is a hassle to do."

So far, i'm really happy with the service i'm getting from Cleanly and their customer support is excellent and responsive if you ever need to call them. One improvement that would be nice is some options around drop-off and pick-up times but i realise that might add costs to the business."

7.0,0.2424,"I have nothing but good things to say about Cleanly. Having just moved to Manhattan from the burbs, I needed an easy wash-and-fold solution that didn't involve trying 50 different local places first. And didn't break the bank.The best things:- The app lets you adjust your pick up and drop off times. Even on the day of. If you get stuck at happy hour, you can change your drop off right then and there.- The customer service is excellent. I had a few things missing from an order once, and I was reimbursed within a week, and given a bonus credit for my next order.- The sheer range of pick up and drop off times makes Cleanly the perfect bet for people with less-than-standard work schedules.- Cleanly Reserve. The $85/year is more than worth it to not have to wait and meet the 30lb minimum for free delivery. Plus all the other perks.Some not-so-great things:- Your laundry will likely be washed by a different laundromat every time. This means you have to get used to some different folding styles, unfolded socks sometimes, and the higher likelihood of losing an article here and there.- Delivery windows can be wonky. As with any delivery service like this (Peapod, etc.) your delivery window depends on the delivery person. Sometimes they're late and sometimes they're early. Just keep this in mind.Overall, I couldn't be more pleased. Cleanly is the best solution for wash and fold services in Manhattan. Hands-down."

Turnaround time is better than what I get at any places locally, and they're priced about the same. But the real reason they get five stars is because they went above and beyond to save my dry cleaning after my well meaning boyfriend decided to toss all my silk blouses in with our wash & fold. Natasha was all over it and the Cleanly team went through all my laundry to pull out the dry clean only items!"
7.0,0.2561,"I've literally tried every single laundry place in my neighborhood. Every single one has disappointed. Either they don't pickup when they say they will,..or I have to hunt them and call repeatedly to get them to deliver,... or they don't give you back your laundry detergent. Cleanly for over a year now has always delivered and picked up on time. The one or two times they didn't,..they gave me a discount code for the next order and they texted me letting me know the delay. In addition, for my first order they delivered a laundry bag, weight it at my doorstep AND they gave me a little chocolate sampler. They only lose one star because they almost never adhere to my notes and preferences. Ever pickup I have to tell the delivery person to make sure the laundry people read my notes. Even then,..they don't do it all the time. Bar none this place is the best!"

Out of the dozen times I've used them, the pickup person has only been later than my window of time maybe two times. The pickup and drop off times are convenient I find as someone who works 9-5 or later. My clothes always arrive smelling nice, if you choose scented detergent of course, and folded perfectly. They have yet to damage any of my clothes or loose anything, etc. highly recommended."

My only complaint however is the valet upon delivery just hanging around waiting for me to tip him. I thought there was no need to tip with Cleanly. Maybe I was wrong, but he sure did make the situation awkward especially when I carried my laundry up a five floor walk up and didn't ask him to do it."

Cleanly does a great job not only with cleaning your clothes the way you want them to be cleaned but they notify you progress every step of the way. Love this communication!! Especially when they have some of your favorite belongings. I did have one instance where they left one of my bags at the Cleanly warehouse. Usually something like this could cause headache but the service was outstanding- they not only made it a priority to get the bag back to me in a timely manner but they put credit on my account as well as gave me promo discounts to encourage me to continue using the service. I haven't had a hiccup with them ever since and even if something like that happens again- i'll be able to depend on them to help me to the best of their ability. Definitely recommend!

7.0,0.2312,"I'm a new Cleanly customer - I first tried one of the competitors since they could pick up the same day whereas Cleanly could not....such a mistake. As they say, ""good things come to those who wait"" :).My first batch of wash and fold - I hadn't done laundry in forever, and plan on donating most of the stuff since I just moved into a much smaller place - came back within 24 hours and was not an issue. Things get really good when it comes to shirt laundry and dry cleaning. A competitor told me ""we'll let you know when it's ready, and then you can schedule"" (see my other reviews if you want more details). Cleanly had me schedule it before it was picked up, for 2 days later. This morning, in spite of me being very tired from being up too late last night, they came within 10 minutes of the start of the delivery window, I then went back to bed :).Cleanly Reserve (their equivalent to Amazon Prime I guess) seems to be worth it. Since there's no minimum order and a 7% discount on top of that, I can have a routine of sending things out on Friday morning and getting them back on Sunday. There are some things for improvement -  first of all the app is iOS only. I'm an Android guy (but have an iOS device for work, so not a HUGE issue, but wish I could use it on my personal device. They do accept orders via the website I think.....).  The delivery windows could use some work as well - there's only the option of morning (i.e. 7AM to 10AM) or evening (6PM to 10PM) for the start of the window - but in 30 minute increments (i.e. you can chose 7-8, 7:30-8:30, etc). More in the middle of the day, especially on weekends, would be much appreciated."

So yes, this is a REAL review, and nothing phony, made up, or some bogus paid advertisement. This is the cold hard truth. Are you ready?I chose a 10 for Cleanly based on the overall outstanding services, communication, and their commitment to getting clothes clean, fresh, and right to your door. From beginning to end, each process that Cleanly laid out in their new annual plan revamp stayed true to what they were aiming for. The advantages to Cleanly are right in their 'membership plans', that you can try out as a trial and both are different in prices. Worth your money? Cost effective and efficient? Well, yeah. Otherwise, I wouldn't be praising Cleanly for their incredible services.As a first time customer, but avid laundry and tech savvy app user, I was skeptical at first, but I truly wanted to give them a chance. My pick-up time that I chose, was between 9:30am - 10:30am. Cliff came at 9:57am. Upon pick-up, my valet guy, Cliff, was on time, very polite, extremely kind, and basically explained all of what Cleanly was about when it came to the 3 types of laundry bags. (Spoiler alert): I even received a little treat as a welcome token. Who does that?! Very kind and caring! None the less, he even sent me a message assuring me that my clothes were in great hands and that he appreciated meeting me as a first time Cleanly customer. Talk about feeling welcomed.I had a ton of clothes that just simply needed the 'wash & fold' treatment, so there was nothing to it. Got to choose my wash preference, including scented or non-scented detergent. (spoiler: They use Tide, in case you're curious). The entire order took 24 hours, and delivery was on time as well! Well taken care of, well folded, and above all, the valet drivers were super cool, kind, and made my day. I was very happy I thought to change my delivery time frame earlier on, to 9am - 10am, and my valet driver, Elvis, came at 9:31am. Thankfully, no fees were needed for the change (Bonus points to savings on the annual Membership plan) My clothes came stacked neatly, in a plastic bag, covered in their trademark Cleanly bags. Let me tell you...they smelled incredible and (spoiler #2: none of my clothes were ruined or damaged!) I did forget to take a photo, however, I'll update with my second order.In the end, Cleanly lived above my expectations, and I'm extremely happy with the team's application revamp.

Hope you take advantage of this because it is a great way to do ur laundry. Prices are good even without the membership, but if you do it often then maybe you should get the membership."
6.0,0.1542,"I have been using Cleanly for several months now and the service has been consistently great. The concierge deliverers have been always nice and prompt. My clothes come back well folded and clean. I've used other delivery services in the past but this, by far, has been the best I've encountered."
8.0,0.1699,"Cleanly is the best door to door laundry service hands down. I have tried ALL of the other competitors (FlyCleaners, Clothespin, etc, etc), and never get the real smell-good clean from my laundry that Cleanly consistently provides. They have never messed up one thing of mine, ever. I use them every week - for the past several months... = lots of laundry.The pickup and delivery folks are also always so nice! Very happy with the service and have used many others that just do not compare, especially on the level on CLEAN that cleanly provides. That's what you really want anyways, right??"
3.0,0.199,"I have been using this service for almost 1 year now.  I was previously using a service in BK that got so bad that they weren't showing up for scheduled appointments and then telling me there was no way I could make that pick up when they are down drivers?! Any, not the case with Cleanly. They are on time with both pick-ups and deliveries.  I love they way they package the closing separating socks and underwear.  I have yet to have anything returned damaged or any missing items.  The customer service delivery operators are courteous. More than I was paying for my last service but you get what you pay for- great service!"
3.0,0.1985,"I really like Cleanly. It fits my lifestyle, as they pickup and deliver laundry at more flexible times of the day than the regular dry cleaner. They have never lost or ruined an item of my clothing, and I've been using them for 3 years. The customer service is extremely accommodating when a delivery is late (which only happened to me once in 3 years). You should definitely use them!"
3.0,0.1694,"I've used Cleanly's services a handful of times, and don't have anything really negative to say at all. It's the first laundry service I've ever used though.. so I don't have a comparison. The pricing I wish was a little cheaper for items that need to hang dry (I wear a lot of work blouses and don't want to pay $1 extra for each item that needs to hang dry, so I use Cleanly for wash & fold only). They've never lost any of my items, that I'm aware of... some towels seem to have bleach spots on them, but I can't be sure if its from my face creams or from their washing."
7.0,0.2012,"As a startup, they have many, many kinks to work out.  Most of the time, though, Cleanly is easy to work with and I have very little issues.  They have damaged a couple items recently and have been stingy with reimbursements.  Also recently, I used to be able to request pickup for same day but now first available only shows 1-3 days out which is frustrating.  I love the hang dry feature."
1.0,0.138,I've used Cleanly for about a year and yes it's a little pricey but I get it back in the time I save sitting in the laundromat. I've had minimal issues and the drivers are always punctual.
2.0,0.1996,"Amazing service. I used to carry my massive laundry bag to a crummy laundromat that washed and folded my clothes for $45 (and they never seemed clean after). Cleanly leaves my clothes perfectly folded (with my delicates individually folded and placed in plastic bags) and everything smells clean and fresh. I even trusted them with my white comforter and duvet last week and it came back perfectly bright and clean. To top it off, I've never spent more than $35 on a Cleanly order (I do laundry at max once a month so my bag is huge). Highly recommend this service. Staff couldn't be nicer and the pick-up/delivery service is a game changer."
6.0,0.1733,"Great service from Cleanly, its really night and day compared to Flycleaners...They always do everything on time, the wash and fold is really great, and the wash a press amazing.A few clothes that flycleaners refused to clean came back spotless! And their customer service is great and responsive.I definitely recommend to anyone."
4.0,0.1838,"I was skeptical to send my laundry out, but I have to say I've been very pleased with Cleanly. I send everything from sheets and towels to delicates. They notify you when they are coming to pick up and drop off. My clothes come back smelling fresh and clean! They even fold my socks, which is cute.Also, they send out emails every once in awhile offering promo codes for dry cleaning and regular wash & fold, which is perfect!"
1.0,0.1628,"I discovered Cleanly when I moved into a building in NYC without laundry in the building and it was a godsent. I've used it religiously for 2 years and had no issues. Consistent, easy, and I've found myself still using it even though I now live in the building with laundry. It's just too convenient and worth the money. Highly recommend"
5.0,0.1556,"If I could give cleanly 20 stars I would.  I own a business and am a single mom to a toddler.   Cleanly has made my life INFINITELY easier.   Its taken laundry off my long long long to do list. Their customer service is outstanding, the clothes come back folded, organized and smelling great.  And its built around my schedule.  Sure a little more expensive but in the long run not for me because the time and stress they have saved me are priceless.  THANK YOU!"
3.0,0.1406,"Overall, great service! They're a little pricey and I've gotten someone else's socks a few times and have lost a shirt or two but very rarely. They're super convenient so I keep using them cause it saves me so much time and effort."

8.0,0.1836,I have to admit I was a skeptic especially after reading the app reviews that weren't all that encouraging. Granted many things can go wrong but I had a great experience with cleanly that surpassed my expectations. Loved the convenience and the results - its changed the way I view laundry and I'm looking forward to my next order!
3.0,0.1459,"Compared to other on demand laundry services I have used, Cleanly is #1.  Their team has always been professional and timely when performing their services.  Recently, they added a same day service which has been a great service to add."
6.0,0.1504,"Great experience using the app for both my laundered clothes and laundry.  I am also a Reserve member, and the service has been effective with a wide range of times to pick up and delivery my clothes.  The clothes always come clean, and their staff have been fast to respond with customer service.  I consistently rely on Cleanly and their service has made my life in Brooklyn easier to manage."
3.0,0.1686,"I am always hesitant to try wash & fold because of my disastrous experience with Marta's Cleaners in Williamsburg, and also the past couple of times I've used pick-up service. However, Cleanly was great. They were timely, delivered my laundry within 24 hours, and NOTHING was missing. I counted each and every item and they were all there, with my socks matched and everything folded perfectly. Only con is that there's a $20 minimum, which with a couple of weeks worth of laundry I could never meet so I'm overpaying every time."
3.0,0.1566,Very convenient and reliable. Always on time. Definitely great value. Sometimes I'll come across a random sock or underwear in my order which is the only negative I've come across. I've never lost anything that I know of though.
0.0,0.1583,I've had a really good experience with Cleanly so far. Things come and go on time and I love that they are using tide and not using fabric softener. The app makes it easy to place a pick up order and coordinate drop offs. I really appreciate the hang dry options for clothes that are more delicate. Glad this service is available in my neighborhood.
8.0,0.1464,Cleanly is reliable and simple to use. The prices are decent and the delivery people are friendly. I'm so pleased with this app. It makes life simpler.

8.0,0.1283,I've been using Cleanly for the past few months for all of my dry cleaning and I love how convenient it is to schedule pick ups/deliveries. I am also very satisfied with the quality of the cleaning results and have just started using their wash & fold service. This service is definitely worth the cost.
3.0,0.1804,"Been using cleanly for about 6 months. They haven't lost anything (which is a plus for NYC laundry service) and they've never been late. No concerns with any of the actual laundry, though I admit I have not tried to wash anything complicated with specific instructions. The overnight service is a plus with cleanly reserve. The shirt pricing at $2.85 is a bit steep for me, but they do a good job with them. Overall I'd recommend for ease of use."

1.0,0.1323,"I was almost put off by some of the comments but went for it as I needed laundry done, and had a great experience - they showed up within the windows, my stuff came back to me well washed and neatly folded. Would definitely recommend and use again!"
1.0,0.1924,"I tried Cleanly during a super busy week at work, I could not find the time to get to the laundromat and the laundry just kept piling up. It was easy and convenient, I also ended up getting stuck late at work the day it was supposed to be delivered and I liked that I was able to go into the app and reschedule my delivery at no charge for the following morning. Pick up and drop off times were both within the first 20 minutes of the estimated 1 hour timeframe and the valet guys were very friendly! I received my laundry back clean and perfectly folded. I'll definitely use this service again!"
3.0,0.2601,"I really enjoy using this service. Even though they lost a couple of my towels, the customer service reps were EXTREMELY accommodating. They followed up every couple of days to provide a status and then reimbursed me with credit when they weren't able to find them (with options to be reimbursed in cash). Luckily, these were just towels, but, I was very appreciative with the way they handled it. Since then, the service has been impeccable-- valet is on time; and I can tell by the way they return my clothes that they take the time to properly care for each of my items."
5.0,0.1422,"This service is very effortless - they come to pick up and drop off at your place. Prices are competitive with others in the city. The only recommendation I would ask for is to bring back their personalized bag ... I received it on the first cleaning and when I sent it back, it disappeared."
3.0,0.1561,"Great service.  They have the fastest turn around time compared to similar laundry services I have tried. Pickups and Deliveries are always on time. Customer service is great, I had a small issue with separating my clothes once and they handled the problem quickly. They don't charge extra to separate clothes or to bleach whites which is nice."

Delivery has likewise been quick and easy, and they'll bring it up to my 4th floor walkup. I've never had an issue with missing clothing or anything lost, and the app is incredibly easy to use."
4.0,0.1667,Love this laundry service! The app is simple to use and I appreciate the text updates to remind me when my laundry will be picked up and dropped off. My laundry always smells good when I get it back and I feel like my clothing is in good hands. My roommates and I don't have a washer/dryer in our apartment and we all use Cleanly. Highly recommend!
7.0,0.2007,I think they have worked out the kinks and now the service is very good. In the beginning I had issues every time I ordered but they were just getting started. Fresher and cleaner than the normal place in the neighborhood and overall good delivery service.
0.0,0.2106,Cleanly has been great. I started using them a few months ago. I had an issue with the pick up of my first order and their customer service was quick to answer and helped resolved my issue. Ive used them about 5 times since and love it. It's super easy with a pick up and drop of only a couple hours i can schedule it whenever is convenient for me. All laundry is clean and folded nicely and smells so fresh! Their pick up and delivery people are very professional and friendly. Will continue to use them!
6.0,0.1442,I think cleanly is great! Always on time and cleaning is in great shape!  Highly recommend.
4.0,0.2168,"This service is such a lifesaver. Door to door service with extra care in each load. My line of work/study has a lot of variation in schedule and workload, so it's nice to be able to depend on Cleanly when I have too much going on to think about laundry. The customizable options for laundry are nice, though I really don't care how my laundry is done. Price can seem a little expensive, but it's worth every penny. It saves hours of time that could instead be spent hanging out with friends, doing work, etc. Also nice that they offer dry cleaning so it's a one stop shop for all of your laundry. The valet's are always friendly and prompt, and keep me updated on the status of my order. The one downside to this service is that after using it, you'll be too lazy to do your own laundry again."
6.0,0.1376,Great service and super convenient.. very response to any feedback and issues! While you may pay a minor premium for the service it is well worth it.. clothes come back clean and nicely folded.
2.0,0.2195,"I highly recommend Cleanly to anyone who doesn't have a washing machine in unit or in their building. I've used it 4 times now and it has worked out great. They have three options: wash and fold, wash and hang dry, and dry clean. I have only used the wash and fold and it was very well done. I love receiving my clothes back smelling great and nicely folded. They also have a rush option (which I haven't used) but it is helpful if you need your clothes back sooner. All in all I am a fan."
5.0,0.1575,I LOVE Cleanly. I had seen an ad for it and was a bit skeptical (as my previous building had a laundry room and I did it myself).  The experience has been amazing.  The app is very easy to use and super flexible based on your laundry needs.  They provide you with a bag to use and will send you notifications when they're on their way.  I haven't had any complaints at all about the the laundered clothes either; comes back smelling so fresh and clean. Highly recommend!

3.0,0.1524,"I've been using Cleanly for a couple years (after a local laundromat lost my clothes and refused to reimburse me). They're incredibly reliable and efficient. They cost a bit more than other laundry options, but you never have to worry about your laundry not getting picked up or dropped off."
5.0,0.1719,"We live directly above a cleaner that we have used for years, but after our first time using Cleanly we have continued to use them! Our laundry comes back clean, folded and smelling fresh but most important the people who pick up and drop off are always so kind! I don't trust just anyone with my baby's clothes (or my husband who is very particular) but after months of using them, I haven't had a single complaint."
7.0,0.1538,I never have to worry about breaking into hives because they offer unscented detergent! They are always timely and the valets are the kindest and most polite people. The customer experience is really fantastic. I can't recommend it enough.

0.0,0.1465,"My experience with Cleanly has been pretty great. Friendly people pick up and drop off. My favorite thing is that my socks are paired and underwear comes rolled. The prices might be a little high, but when you factor in the time of the laundromat...I think it evens out."
6.0,0.1393,"Terrific service. Very good quality cleaning. Courteous and prompt valet delivery and pickup. My one wish is that they'd use common sense if they catch a dry clean item in the wash/fold bag or vice versa. Other than that, bravo. Also, the detergent smells awesome."
3.0,0.1595,"I've used all the major services out there and have had MAJOR problems with others - clothes ruined, things washed instead of dry cleaned, huge holes, lost items for days, etc. BUT - so far so good with Cleanly. A lost sock has been my only complaint. That and their dry cleaning comes back smelling pretty strong, so I just don't use it anymore. The hang dry feature (while expensive) is awesome and I've never had any problems scheduling pick up or delivery."
2.0,0.146,"Cleanly has been a lifesaver.  I was complaining to a friend that my work schedule never fits with laundromat hours and she recommended Cleanly.  I was a little hesitant as I can be a bit particular about my clothes (hang dry, gentle cycle, etc.), but I decided to test the Reserve free trial.I love the app and the service.  It's so convenient to schedule (and even reschedule) pickup and delivery, and the valets are always on time.  I like the option of hang dry, and that I can send in my delicates in a separate lingerie bag.  All of my clothes have come back clean.  I had a couple items come back with some leftover suds dried on them, but Customer Service got back to me right away with a solution/credit."

If you spend more than $30, you get free delivery every time (which, between two people in a week, you can definitely meet). The bags they give you to use for their service are also some of the best laundry bags I've come across. Overall, highly recommended service."

3.0,0.1871,I originally started using FlyCleaners for my laundry service but their customer service wasn't great and they lost several of my clothing items. After losing my items and taking 2 months to resolve (refund me 50% of value) I decided to give Cleanly a try. Cleanly's customer service is great! Very responsive. They seem much more organized and so far I've loved the way my clean clothes have been returned to me.

It is so easy to s hedule on the app and they send you updates and reminders. Additionally, I would definitely go for the reserve membership. It seems expensive up front but if you calculate it out you will more than make up for it."

7.0,0.1481,"I'm a big fan of the convenience of using Cleanly.com. I can order laundry service through their easy to use app, the prices are only slightly higher than my neighborhood laundry services and I can track my pick-ups and deliveries. I couldn't give them 5 stars though as they have some operational bugs to work out - pickup/delivery has been late on more than one occasion. But overall the service is good and I'll continue to use them."
4.0,0.1571,"Every single thing about this process was seamless and amazing. Laundry that gets picked up at 8pm and dropped off the next morning at 6:30am sounds unreal, but this is the real deal. The app sends you a reminder and a pic and info on your driver as well as an actual locator tool that allows you to see their exact location on a map. They are super professional and friendly, and most importantly, on time( no wondering if they may or may not be on time). I feel like I should be a spokesperson for this company, because I literally have raved to everyone I know about them."

While it costs slightly more, it definitely is worth the time it frees up in my day. The valet members are really pleasant and I've always had a good experience with them. My only complaint is that sometimes I put clothes in a separate bag with instructions to hang dry only and they have put it in the dryer. I've learned my lesson and haven't done that since, but now only use Cleanly for wash and fold."
7.0,0.166,"To be honest - this is one of the best services out there.  I don't like the movement toward a subscription-based premier service, but they also take care of you.  My garments are cleaned and the delivery professionals are top notch and aren't scary looking.  They come on time, great appearance, helpful, etc.  I have moved from my beloved neighborhood laundromat to them - solely because they will pick up and deliver.  Not a single reason to give less than 5 stars."

I use it specifically for laundered shirts and dry cleaning, and Cleanly never fails to get my clothes looking great!The bag they give you makes it really convenient. I have a door man so I just leave my clothes at the desk in the morning and then they are back the next day when I get home. Exactly what I need."
6.0,0.1498,We've been using Cleanly for about a year and have been really pleased.  The app is easy to use and the valets are courteous and timely. If there is ever an issue their customer service is responsive and helpful. Pleased with the quality of the dry cleaning.
8.0,0.1905,"FlyCleaners is cheaper but they're notorious for poor service and have an 'F' with the BBB so I opted for Cleanly once they came to Park Slope. I don't mess around with clothing; it's expensive, and I do need it back. All of it back. Haven't been disappointed, they do a superb job, better than any laundromat I've used. Everything is properly cleaned, sorted, organized and wrapped in plastic, even matched socks. I appreciate the flexibility and the ability to change drop off and pickup times. I'll update this review if something eventually goes wrong (which seems to be a common theme with these services; it's good up until the point they screw up in the worst way possible) but for now it's a 5/5. I hope it stays that way. One thing I miss is same-day service; i understand this is probably logistical nightmare for the Cleanly people, but for me, and probably a lot of other users, we'd be happy to pay a substantial premium for that service. It's the one thing local laundromats have that Cleanly lacks."
7.0,0.1631,"I started using cleaning the very first week I moved to New York. I haven't quite been able to break the habit. Ordering and scheduling are quick and easy. Their staff both on the customer service side and the pickup/delivery side, are communicative and friendly. I have saved a ton of time since using it and can safely say have not had a single bad experience. My clothes always come back clean and neatly folded. If there is ever an issue, Cleanly customer service has been front and center to meet my requests. I am looking forward to using Cleanly for a long time."

5.0,0.165,Cleanly is extremely convenient and the clothes come back really well washed! I would give them 5 stars for service. The four stars is only due to the price which is a bit high to wash with them all the time. I will definitely use them when I can.
5.0,0.1481,"supper helpful cleaning service Cleanly has been super helpful and great! I live on the UES and work downtown so it's hard to find a cleaner that's still open by the time I get home. I can get pick ups and delivery even at 9pm which is so convenient for my sched! Clothes smell so good. A 30-minute delivery window would be helpful, or maybe same day wash and fold, but overall like it a lot."
3.0,0.1431,"Was nervous about having lost laundry, but hasn't happened yet after several months of steady use. Reserve membership is worth it if you want laundry done at least twice per month. Every pickup/dropoff person we've had has been friendly and helpful."
1.0,0.1337,Cleanly is the best ! I have used other laundry delivery services and they have made me break out in rashes because of the detergent they use. Cleanly only uses Tide. The service can get a little pricey but it's definitely worth it and they are always on time.
2.0,0.1744,"I switched from Flycleaners to Cleanly and have been so happy. Anyone who says that all laundry apps are the same clearly haven't tried Cleanly. You are able to separate your hang dry items in its own bag, ensuring they will be treated properly. Every time my clothes are returned, they are done promptly and with precision. Not once have I received a white sock turned red, or a load missing items. I love Cleanly!"
6.0,0.1731,"I started using Cleanly about a year ago and it is life changing! It is a bit pricier than the place across the street but the quality is so superior that it makes up for it. The flexible hours are also really helpful because I can schedule it around my work schedule . The customer service is really great and responsive and everyone I've encountered from the company has been great! I also have a lot of random, fun/patterned socks and they often come back matched and folded- that little touch is amazing!!"

Cleanly has much more pick up and drop off availability in my experience, and the turn around is much quicker (especially with dry cleaning). All the valets have been friendly and professional.

The only thing that's ever gone wrong is once the driver was delayed and didn't show up until after the window I had booked, but he wasn't more than ten minutes late so it wasn't really that big a deal for me. I love the convenience of the app, and the speediness and customizability of the services!"

2.0,0.2024,"I've been using Cleanly regularly for the last six months. I've never had a problem - the app is easy to use; the valets are always on time; and clothes are laundered/dry-cleaned as per the instructions. I'm a fan of the ""hang dry"" feature and appreciate that they separate lights and colors and give you the option of cold/hot wash. I've had to reach out to their customer service on a few occasions, and they've been extremely polite, prompt and helpful. I pay the annual subscription which gets me free hang dry, free delivery and a discount on every bill. I think it's a great deal! The only downside to Cleanly is that you don't get the option of same-day delivery that you'd get with your neighborhood laundry service."

8.0,0.1561,"After having tried out several other services (from local offerings to FlyCleaners) I am still beyond impressed with Cleanly. The app is simple and easy, the service is prompt, they have the highest quality delivery bag I've found, have never lost my clothes after several (+6) months of use, and my clothes come shrink-wrapped in cellophane each time! Next stop, The 5th Element! Only improvement I could offer is to give customers the option of adding $5 to get a hand scale to know before people come if you meet the minimum pound requirement."

1.0,0.1965,"This service was a total life saver. I had absolutely no time to do a few weeks worth of laundry during a time of heavy travel. Cleanly came to the rescue! They picked up within minutes of my scheduled time slot beginning, and dropped off just the same. The person who dropped off the clothes managed to make a 4th floor walkup with a heavy bag of laundry-- I was impressed. The clothes came back perfectly folded and easy to organize. My dry cleaned dress came back in perfect condition. Would definitely recommend; and they come to Brooklyn!"
2.0,0.1769,"The service is arguably one of the best for wash and fold and their laundered shirts service is nice as well. Promotions crop up pretty regularly, however many of these are for specific services like dry cleaning which I don't usually need. That being said, I wish the wash and fold prices could come down just a bit from $1.50/pound. If that could be managed, Cleanly would be on top in no time."
5.0,0.1922,"Ahhh Cleanly. Where do I start?! The relationship began two months ago. After moving into my new apartment, I found that the biggest struggle for me was laundry. I live in a 6 story walk up and the nearest laundromat was a 15 minute walk away. Carrying 20 pounds of laundry back and forth was beginning to become a burden, but then Cleanly came into my life. It was love at first click. Creating my order was so simple and the app is beautiful!! Then hours later this wonderful amazing being arrived at my door and took away my laundry. They helped me with all the questions I had, PLUS I got chocolate. Yes you read that right, CHOCOLATE. I received my laundry the next day and it was smelled so damn good. I was hooked ever since.Cleanly is like that amazing boyfriend that comes into your life after you've been struggling with a horrible one for so long. Thank you for making my life easier!!!"
4.0,0.1848,"I started using Cleanly when I move to the city and the closest laundromat was 5 block away up a very steep and long hill! I needed a convenient and trusting laundry service. My friend told me about Cleanly. After the first few services I immediately became a reserve member. In the 2 years I've been using cleanly only one article of clothing shrunk. I contacted the customer service - boy are they AWESOME! - and they right away asked me to send them a pic which they will follow up with a reimbursement. Another time they accidentally dry cleaned my jeans, which was very nice of them but totally unnecessary, and of course they reimbursed me for that over charge as well. I tell all my friends about this service and can't imagine doing my own laundry again."
5.0,0.1597,"Cleanly is the greatest thing to ever happen to laundry service and it absolutely breaks my heart that we recently moved just outside of their service area (hi from boerum hill!) but I will be checking constantly to see if they expand to us.Why go Cleanly?1) They're amazingly punctual. Placed an order for between 9 and 11 am? They'll be there, 95% of the time, right at 9 am on the dot. 2) They're very friendly. 3) They'll weigh your laundry right at your door to give you an accurate cost estimate. 4) You get chocolates for joining!5) The laundry always looks and smells fantastic.6) The app is clean, beautiful, and easy to use.Seriously. Don't waste your time with other services. Cleanly is incredible."

7.0,0.1548,"Cleanly really is the best option for dry cleaning in NYC. I've been using Cleanly for about 2 years now and have not had one issue. There are constantly promotions going on to make it even better to use the service. By scheduling time slots, the pick up and drop off is always predictable. Before turning to Cleanly, I had horrible experiences with dry cleaners near my apartment building and was skeptical to use an app. However, it has proved to go above and beyond my expectations. I recommend Cleanly to anyone and everyone. While it may be slightly more pricey than other cleaners, the quality of the service from delivery time to product is always superb. Highly recommend!"
8.0,0.3374,"These guys are WINNERS. Laundry seems like such a simple thing - how can so many (literally hundreds) of small laundromats/services screw it up? It's baffling because laundry doesn't just seem simple, it actually really is simple. How hard can it be to NOT:* lose my clothes* shrink my clothes* destroy my clothes* somehow make my clothes smell worse after ""washing"" them* lie about washing my clothes* burn my clothes (yes, it happened!!)* always be lateTangent/rant, Cleanly review resumes next paragraph:Not to get spicy, but FlyCleaners has a special place in hell. If Cleanly had an evil twisted sister, it would be FlyCleaners. Everything FlyCleaners does wrong, Cleanly does right. FlyCleaners outsources everything and has become this pathetic colossal operation that doesn't give a damn about customer service. They're a fancy app that facilitates a stranger destroying your clothes in some far away land.Anyways, back to the superstars here. Cleanly rethinks EVERYTHING.I really admire how cautious Tom was when launching this service. I have no connection to him, but I tweet a lot and for months asked him to expand to the East Village. Cleanly took its time and only grew when they were ready. And wow, are they ready!!!He wrote the app from scratch. It works great. The delivery people are nice. They always arrive on time. They give you chocolate. They weigh the bag in your apartment with a travel luggage scale to give you an estimate. They wash your clothes correctly. They sort correctly. They follow your demanding instructions correctly. They deliver your clothes on time with a smile at a price cheaper than most laundromats (!!!!). You are absolutely bonkers or just plain ignorant if you're doing laundry any other way. YES, I am judging you as you haul your bag of laundry down 14th in the blizzard since you probably paid more than if you were to use Cleanly. Yep, I think you're stupid (or probably lying) if you say you have to hurry and dip out so you can grab your clothes before the laundromat closes. This is 2015, we live in the most populous city in the country, I'll get my clothes cleaned through an app. Thanks!This isn't a jab at Cleanly, but like I said above, laundry in general really isn't *that* hard to do. Sure, there are a lot of things that can go wrong, but it's not hard to avoid them. Cleanly changes the game by being the only ones who seem to be able to pull it off well. Cheers to them."

4.0,0.1578,"I've had a great experience with Cleanly. I moved to Manhattan in August and started living without a washer and dryer for the first time. I didn't want to spend hours in a laundromat. I could save money by dropping off and picking up my clothes from my local laundromat (they charge .99 a pound and Cleanly charges $1.50), but I enjoy the convenience of my laundry being picked up and dropped off at my door. They have always been within the one hour window when picking up and dropping off. I do wish the detergent they used was more strongly scented because I like for my laundry to have a strong, fresh smell, but I'm sure many people who are sensitive to scents like it how it is. My hang dry clothes always come back wet, but that doesn't bother me. I will continue using them to do all my laundry."
4.0,0.1869,"I have been using the cleanly app for about 10 months now - usually sending laundry out a few times a month. It's super convenient and the Cleanly Reserve plan is awesome for waiving the fees (1 day turnaround, hang dry, rescheduling delivery). No issues with the laundry itself, the attendants are friendly and prompt (only maybe 3 times have arrived outside of the 1 hour window by 5-10 minutes). Laundry was my biggest frustration when moving to the city and Cleanly solved that! Highly recommended."

My laziness won over and I decided to try cleanly after seeing a promo code on the subway. I have to say I am pretty impressed with my experience, I downloaded the app which was really straight forward and easy to use and I had a driver at my door the next morning to pick up my clothes. I received my clothes back the next evening, they were neatly folded and I even got a free laundry bag and found my old one folded at the bottom. All in all a great experience."

I actually like to do my laundry, my dream is to have a washer/dryer in my apartment one day, but I'm not there yet. Also, I even have laundry in my building that is cheap, but why do I choose to spend more and use a service? TIME! I recently have started a new job that has resulted in less and less ""free time"" and laundry was becoming a big time suck that I couldn't afford. Enter CLEANLY!Pros:+ Beautifully designed and highly functional app+ Intuitive service offerings+ Great branding and quality+ The clothes smell clean, and the laundry products seem to be high quality.+ Personalized service that is consistent across the experience.Cons:+ So far, same day service is not available, maybe it will come in the future. I would love to be able to have an early morning pickup and a late night delivery option.+ More expensive than other services, the dry cleaning is a bit ridiculous in my opinion. However, I continue to use it because the quality remains high.I hope they expand into house cleaning, if they can bring this quality to maid services, I'll hire them!"
0.0,0.1511,"I've been using Cleanly for 8 months now and I love it! Super reliable and very friendly service.

I also love the ability to set my wash and fold preferences for good - so creating a new order is just a few taps.

4.0,0.2092,Excellent service. I received a text like usual that my laundry was delivered. My doorman had no record of the delivery and couldn't find it in the package room. I of course panic as I was leaving for a trip overseas the next day. I called Cleanly and even in my panicked state the woman on the phone was beyond friendly and professional. It turns out they have their valets take a photo of the lobby of the building where the laundry is dropped off! So impressive (and a smart business practice). Photo in hand I went back to the doorman and after some time they track down my missing laundry bag. I'm so glad I signed up for Cleanly's Reserve service and would recommend to anyone.

The first time I ever used them I mistakenly asked for a blanket to be rush delivered (they clearly state bankers can't be done overnight), they emailed right away to explain the problem and promised to send it back I cleaned along with the rest of my clean laundry. When the delivery arrived the blanket wasn't there.

Much better than any local wash & fold service in the area and the convenience is worth it. Also the box of chocolates they give you is a nice gesture!"
2.0,0.2364,"I used cleanly once and was very pleased with the level of service.  The valet who picked up the clothes was the same one who returned them and he was very kind and polite.   I like the garment/laundry bag and the chocolates were a nice touch.  I'm not sure if fabric softener was used in the wash/fold, if it was I couldn't tell.  I prefer fabric softener but that's just me and I wish it was an option.  As for the hanging laundry it was OK.  One of the shirts came back more wrinkled than I expected.  My sweater took an extra day because they said it was not cleaned to their standards which is odd because it wasn't dirty, I just like them to be fresh, I had worn it twice. One of the shirts either came back with stains (the look like light grease stains) or they were on there and I didn't notice.  Either way, they should have been addressed.  I may use the service again, I am a little on the fence.  If you are not super particular about your laundry then I would say it's the perfect service.  If you are a little more particular it may be best to do your own laundry.  For pure convenience it is a great service, maybe a little fine tuning to make it a stellar service."

I'm not a huge fan of chemical detergents and would love to see them offer something less environmentally impactful.Otherwise a great service, I'm really picky about who washes and folds my laundry. I've moved several times in NYC and still use only one laundromat because all the other ones leave my clothes smelling kinda watery and musty.

The first step of creating my account and setting up the first pick up took no more then couple of minutes, but the biggest feature of this great service is the flexibility and accuracy on pick-up and delivery times. when usually getting back home long after cleaners are already closed, cleanly allows you to choose what time my laundry will be delivered, and allows you to changes the times prior to the scheduled time, something that is almost impossible to manage doing when using cleaners.Overall i had a great experience with the app itself and with their service, can't see how i'm going back."

1.0,0.2281,"I'm a new user and needed laundry quick.  We had just moved out of a building with laundry and I wasn't sure where the best/closest laundromat was.  I had a $20 discount for Cleanly and figured I'd give it a try.  I scheduled my pick up for early morning before I left for work.  I was worried that they'd be late, and I'd be late in turn.  My valet, Joshua, showed up right on time and brought the laundry bag, dry cleaning bag and a brownie!  He weighed the laundry while I waited and gave me an estimate.  He followed up with a text message to make sure there weren't any special instructions for my wash.I received a receipt for their support team a little later that day and noticed that the $20 code had not been applied.  I e-mailed to inquire and they quickly got back and offered to manually take the code off of my total.  I scheduled a late evening drop off due to work and again my valet, Lino, showed up right on time.  I had requested 5 items to be hang dried (included in their service) and in addition to those 5 items, they had hung a couple of my dresses that don't fold as easily.  All of my laundry was returned in perfect condition.  I don't know that I'll be a regular customer, it's a bit more than I want to pay for laundry, but it's a great service for when you're in a pinch.  Overall, they made a very great first impression!"

0.0,0.1841,"I used this service in DC after I hurt my back and had several loads to do. So easy, pick up and drop off-they bring you a bag. Clothes smell amazing. The separate and group things together and the folding is really good. Highly recommend. App is easy to use."
3.0,0.2,"Cleanly is easily the best service of it's kind. I'd used Flycleaners in the past, which is comically bad and disorganized, so Cleanly has been a huge breath of fresh air. They respond to any questions or changes for an order extremely quickly, they allow you to coordinate orders with a roommate, and they consistently email promocodes for discounts. The only negatives are that it's a little expensive, but I understand that their service requires that, and that I have trouble hitting the minimum weight for wash and fold, so I'll run out of things I wear often but not have enough total laundry to meet the minimum, which can be frustrating and costly. Overall better than others for sure!"
6.0,0.1481,"Cleanly is great. The app is super intuitive and very well designed. The ability to schedule time windows for pick up / delivery, next day service, and the overall quality of the washing and drying makes this the Go-To Laundry service in New York City!"

I love that I can send out my laundry when I get home from work and get it delivered before I leave for work. Works great with my schedule. Like others have said, the hang dry items normally come back very wet for me. I immediately take them out of the plastic (I had one load sour this way) and hang them individually. I wish they were a little more dry, but nothing stopping me from giving them a great review! Thanks Cleanly for your service!!"

2.0,0.1605,"Awesome laundry service! They give you a 1 hour window for pick up/drop off, but usually always come right at the beginning of that window. They will send a text 1 hour before the scheduled time to remind you (in case you need to run home) and then another text when the driver in literally en route (usually 5-10 minutes away). Your clothes and sheets come back perfectly folded every time, and socks are usually even matched up! The only complaint I have it that a few socks have gone missing and we have gotten some random socks back, so I don't recommend sending any socks that you would be devastated to lose. But everything else has always been returned in great condition. And the delivery man is always really friendly and professional."
0.0,0.2057,Trust me.. it's been years of unsatisfactory to mediocre laundry services. I can't think of a single thing this business falls short on.

0.0,0.2194,"Cleanly is super convenient. Pick up and delivery were timely, and the app is easy to use.

The app was easy to use and allowed me the flexibility to change my delivery time (something my local cleaner has had difficulty with), and my clothes were returned nicely folded and smelling fresh and clean. Additionally, the reps picking up and dropping off were very nice (extra points for the brownie). The service was slightly more expensive than my local cleaner, but the ease of use makes it worth it. I will definitely use this service again."

8.0,0.1429,Good way to clean cheap clothes conveniently. The app is easy to use and the delivery is flexible and allows changes to accommodate your schedule when things come up. The service is also extra convenient and slightly cheaper if you have a doorman in your building.
1.0,0.1369,"Super convenient. Valets didn't blink at the ridiculously huge load of laundry we had (family of 4, coming out of a nomadic period) or the 4th floor walk up. Only issue I had was that we noted a broken buzzer and the valets didn't seem to have gotten the message; that said, they called me when no one responded to the buzzer, so end result was the same. The app lets you see where the valet is, which is a little big brother for me, but also was helpful in being ready when the drop off was happening."

6.0,0.1711,Cleanly really changed the game for me!The fact that I can schedule my cleanly pick up to come while I am getting ready for work is great.

The quality is great and the customer service is always helpful.Improvements: calendar reminders...sometimes I forget.

1.0,0.1692,I used to use fly cleaners but have been much happier with cleanly. Always within the allotted time frame.  Prices can be a bit steep and everyone once in awhile the clothes are a little damp. Overall makes laundry really easy since for those with a busy schedule.
0.0,0.15,Really convenient and easy. If they ever miss a drop off deadline they give you a credit. App interface is straightforward.
7.0,0.1671,"These people are actually amazing (shoutout to Andrew!). I used to use Flycleaners and I have to say my life is vastly improved since using Cleanly. I've had situations where I was not home when they tried to deliver and they cheerfully changed my delivery time, or when I was running late and they actually waited the 5-10 minutes until I got home. They are extremely punctual, highly reliable and overall it's been an absolute pleasure being their customer. I once sent a dress in to be dry cleaned and forgot the hem had fallen out. Rather than just cleaning it and probably causing further damage, they called me and asked how I'd like it to be handled, called me back with a hemming price quote (extremely reasonable, I think $10-$15), had their team hem and clean the dress and then delivered both my laundry and the dry cleaning on time. I cannot say enough good things about this company. Oh and they bring you chocolate! The only suggestions I have would be 30 minute pickup/delivery windows as opposed to an hour. Oh and if they extended the Cleanly brand to things like house cleaning, closet organizing, etc. Either way, they earned every last star. I'm hooked and will be a long term customer."
0.0,0.1682,App is user friendly. I love that there are multiple selections for pickup/drop off for those who are very busy. Clothes smelled great! Pick-up and drop off occurred during the time slot selected...they weren't late! Love Cleanly; I will continue to use their services.
7.0,0.1637,The app is simple to use - and pickup/deliveries are always on time. Works as advertised!

0.0,0.1517,I've only tried them once but LOVED it! They are super on time. They haven't lost anything. And though this was just 12 lbs of wash & dry they somehow got some old stains I couldn't even get out when I wash at my local laundromat. I highly recommend Cleanly!!!
4.0,0.1436,Cleanly is the best thing I've invested in since living in the city! You can schedule pickup and delivery of your laundry very easily on their app and list all your washing preferences. I used to have all my clothes washed at the local dry cleaner but they always seemed to lose or shrink something. As a cleanly reserve member I also get 10 hang dry items for free each time and an additional 7% off. Highly recommended!!
6.0,0.1585,Generally a great service. Have had one or two issues (stapling a ticket through my husbands laundered shirts) but overall very convenient and reliable.

Super friendly delivery people, best quality for dry clean I stumbled upon in NYC.No idea why people still go to the nearest laundromat near home, I got at least 2-3 hours a week back by not doing it myself. Fair price for the time it saves me.Had no problems so far and quality only went up during the last half a year. Try it you won't be sorry."
2.0,0.1574,I used cleanly for dry cleaning and pressing only. Everything was picked up and returned on time and came back in great condition!
7.0,0.1763,I I've had nothing but good experiences with the service. Valets are great and don't complain about carrying my laundry up and down four flights of stairs. My laundry has always come back clean and folded nicely. Pickup and delivery has always been on time. I particularly enjoy that when you place an order and set your pickup and delivery times the Cleanly app integrates into my calendar and allows me to add the times as events with just a few clicks. My only complaint is that there is no Cleanly app for Android and I'd love to see one added. Overall I love Cleanly and I highly recommend it!

We want to make sure you're OK with us putting it through a cleaning (I attached photos).We always prefer to double check in these types of situations to be on the safe side.

6.0,0.1389,"My favorite laundry service, it is better than the local laundry service- and you don't have to pick up or drop off! The pickups and deliveries are always within the time windows and the service is great. Love the hang dry option! My clothes always come back smelling fresh!"
8.0,0.3608,"I rarely write reviews, partly because I'm lazy, and partly because I think people who nitpick are pretentious and irritating, but in this case Cleanly deserves to be praised. I grew up in a household where we were expected to do our own laundry, since I was tall enough to reach the buttons and was trusted to not to chug the detergent bottle while mommy wasn't looking.  Of course this all changes when you no longer have access to your own laundry machine (oh how I took that for granted.) So when I made the move to the big city, the thought of someone else doing my laundry was foreign.  While I'm not covered head to toe in designer fashions, I like to wear nice clothes that require extra care.  I was very worried handing over some of my most prized possessions (I work in fashion so naturally I'm shallow) and unmentionables to total strangers. For the first few months I was lugging my laundry down 2nd avenue, sweating up a storm prior to starting a 10 hour work day, and rushing home before the 6:30/7 cut off time, which put me right back on 2nd avenue, lugging away. I thought to myself: there has got to be a better way! I started using fly cleaners for a couple of months and while it was good in the beginning, I noticed that my clothes started slowly disappearing, and my detailed instructions were starting to be ignored (like drying delicates on high heat, WTF Man?) The straw that broke the camel's back is when they sent back all of my clothes folded inside out.  One of my favorite things about getting my laundry done is how neatly they fold it (something I was never able to master) so I can easily place it directly into my dresser.  I couldn't fathom paying all that money for a half ass job. But there was no going back. I was totally addicted to the on-demand laundry service. I blame my roommate for introducing me to this new designer drug. I decided to look elsewhere and stumbled upon Cleanly, and I am over the moon! Let me tell you the ways:1. Their delivery people are insanely nice, like really really nice. The kind of nice you don't experience in this city too often. It's like they found the nicest people in the world and hired them. Mr. Rogers would work there, and would be considered the ""office grump"", that's how friendly they are2. My Clothes are always exactly how I ask. I have a lot of delicate clothes, some with very specific instructions, though I hate being so particular and needy (I never complain at restaurants, I hate sending back my order, etc. I pride myself on how easy going I am) they never make me feel guilty and do it with a smile on their face 3. They have yet to loose any of my clothes. While I'm sure this will eventually happen as their business grows and have more orders to keep track of, they seem to have a great system in place4. I sent in an expensive and fairly new blazer to be dry cleaned.  They sent me an email notifying me of  a tear at the seam on the sleeve (probably something I had done while having one to many at the 13th Step, shameful, I know) which included a photo. They asked if I wanted to continue with the dry cleaning.  I said it was fine and for them to continue. I figured I would just take it to a seamstress myself. To my surprise Cleanly replied: ""I spoke to our facility manager, and although we don't offer alterations at this time, she agreed to sew the tear. It will be free of charge, and we will put it to cleaning after. Have a great night!"" I couldn't believe it. It made me feel warm and fuzzy inside, and not like that warm and fuzzy when you drink a bottle of wine on an empty stomach. More like the warm and fuzzy you feel when you see dolphin and dog best friend. Most companies these days won't go that extra mile for their customers. Thank you Cleanly, for reminding me that there are still are companies (and people!) in this world that give a damn. 5. They are always prompt and timely, even with my early mornings and late nights 6. I totally forgot about my laundry drop off (my fault since I ignored the reminder texts while walking home and talking to a girlfriend on the phone) And walked up to my building where my cleanly valet was patiently waiting for me in the snow. I felt sooooo awful and she was so very sweet about the whole thing. I tried to tip her extra for her troubles but she graciously declined. Her name is Nicole, so Cleanly if you are reading this give her a big raise since she is very kind and patient with clueless idiots like myself.  7. The app is clean, simple, and beautifully designed. Super easy to use especially for busy professionals who don't have the time to drop off/pick up laundry 8. Totally unexpected mini box of chocolates that they give you when they pick up your first order. I had mine for breakfast, so so good. Obviously I'm a little obsessed, but I can't help it. So give cleanly a try! You won't regret it!!"

4.0,0.1693,"I like doing laundry, but it's really inconvenient in my building. Fortunately, I *love* having my laundry done, especially the part where it comes back all compressed into a perfect fabric cube. But never before have I used a service with such a perfect interface--from the pickup and delivery people to the top-notch customer-service email team to the sleek, friendly app. It's more seamless than Seamless. It's not just that your laundry gets whisked away, washed, dried, pressed, dry-cleaned, delivered. It's squeaky-clean without being perfumey, perfectly folded (I challenge the Gap/Army to do better), and thoughtfully sorted. Every time I've had a question or request, they've answered almost instantaneously. I love them and couldn't recommend them more highly!"

8.0,0.2199,"Ive been on the UWS for around 7 years now and had probably switched laundry services about once a year. Now this may seem excessive, however it was due to the fact that they either lost entire loads of laundry, weren't open at the right time, couldn't really follow through on agreed delivery times and charged more than they should just for some wash and fold. Clearly I was in search of something that would be WAY better. As luck would have it Cleanly started on the UWS & UES and I immediately gave it a go. I was hesitant at first (cause how could something so simple to use actually follow through on everything after the order was placed?) but that quickly subsided. What an incredible job this team does. The app incredibly easy to use, looks awesome and takes all the effort out on my end. The follow through on communication (via Text) is great - I know step by step whats happening. The actual pick up and drop off? I love the fact that they weigh it in front of you and that they are quite possibly the nicest people ever.The price point - $1.50/lb for all of the above? Yes please. The options for more than just wash and fold? Winner. The occasional deals and discounts are awesome too - I donated bags of clothes for $10 credit per bag and that was beyond amazing. 2 birds, 1 stone. (donating to those who need and having it picked up with my laundry)All in, I have to give it 5 stars - in 4 months of using it not one thing has been wrong about any of it. So happy to have this service."

Select pickup and drop off times from their app, and wait for their friendly people to arrive - so far (4 orders) they've always been perfectly on time.

They also provide you with your own laundry and dry cleaning bags so it's really easy."

Same person delivered the laundry and carried it all the way upstairs and was so nice. They placed my nice shirts and pants on hangers and didn't dry them which was really considerate! Such good treatment of my clothes which is really appreciated. Oh and they give you a really nice laundry bag and garment bag! Seriously so easy and great service!!

3.0,0.1793,"Having been a customer of another laundry delivery company (that made service promises they couldn't keep) I was skeptical about the competition... I downloaded the app and was immediately impressed. It has a clean (forgive the pun) design and is very easy to use. The options are clear and booking a pickup delivery time is easy enough. The best thing is, they have an email support system and TELEPHONE NUMBER to call if you need to talk to a real human being. I even made contact with the CEO who asked me for constructive feedback based on other experiences I had had with competitors in the same market. Wonderfully responsive customer service, clothes are clean, fresh, picked up and delivered on time. No hidden fees, what you pay is what you pay. This service helps to free up my time to be more productive in other areas and costs a little bit more than doing it myself. No brainer. Great job guys!!"
