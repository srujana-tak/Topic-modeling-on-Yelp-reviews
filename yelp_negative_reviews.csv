0.0,0.2484,"BEYOND TERRIBLE SERVICE. I'm not one to write reviews but I felt it necessary. This is the 5th time now I've had an issue with Cleanly services. Not once have they ever accommodated after each issue/damage. Customer service is pathetic. 1. Ripped and torn items (shirts, sheets)2. White duvet cover stained dark blue 3. Whites stained gray color 4. Requested and paid for overnight service and customer service replied 1 day later saying their driver was unable to complete the drop off and ultimately dropped off 3 days late - still charged for overnight fees.5. Most recently I received my white curtains heavily stained and ultimately had to throw them out (which I bought for $65) - at this time I was leaving on vacation for a week and did not report it until I returned. Customer service responded by saying ""since you reported after 7 day window we cannot do anything"" Needless to say, I will no longer use their services. They are unreliable and will end up costing you more money to replace your items that they damage. I recommend switching to ""FlyCleaners!!!!!"""
5.0,0.3761,"This was my first time using Cleanly. I decided to give it a try despite so many negative reviews online - that was mistake. I handed over 1 full size duvet cover, 1 full size fitted sheet and 2 standard pillow cases. The next day I received a text saying that my full size sheets did not fit in the washing machine and that they could not be hung dry. Therefore the two pillow cases would be washed and the sheets would be returned ""uncleaned.....""Huh? How are the washers  too small for standard full size sheets? The rinky-dink washers down my block can fit full sheets. Why could they not be hung dry? Again, they are standard full size sheets- not queen or King. Why accept full size sheets if you cannot actually wash or dry them?Lastly, I do not believe the pillow cases were even washed-- and ALL of the bedding came back crumpled, even the pieces that were not washed. This was an enormous waste of time. Just go through your local laundromat"

0.0,0.2609,"****Updated review****I've attached 2 screenshots. Over 1 year, the price for washing bed sheets has went up $8 to $11, which is 37.5% mark up..... if you do the math. Their wash & fold price has also gone up 10 cent/lb now $1.6/lb. I literally just sent my laundry out 2 weeks ago in December 2018 and I can assure you it was $1.5/lb. It would be nice if customers were noticed of those price change. My #1 problem with cleanly is that they kept charging me extra, claiming the $2 bed sheets I got from Amazon deserves ""superior"" treatments. And each time I have to contact customer service to correct it. But how many people don't check their invoice or just don't give a fuck? I'm not even going to mention how many times cleanly misplaced my laundry items. Actually, the first time I used cleanly in 2017 summer, they lost my bf's brooks brother shirts! Yet I still decided to stick with cleanly. After returning to cleanly after taking a break and yet again, I found myself disappointed in cleanly's service. Nahhh fuck off cleanly, imma go & support local laundry mats. And this time I mean it! Whoever is reading this review, You should too."

They took my clothes two nights ago and I was supposed to receive them all yesterday morning (paid for the overnight fee) and waited an hour past the window. They told me there was an issue with my card and I said run it again, there's no issue. There's no response from them. You get an automated chat on the app with computer answers rather than an actual human. They have all of my workout clothes, work clothes and underwear. Which is really fun. I've used them before with no problems so I'm extremely upset. I would rather just go to this holding facility they claim to have my stuff at and go get my belongings back myself. Would like a phone call and resolution ASAP...I'll update if I hear anything."

2.0,0.1991,"Great idea, terrible execution. Don't waste your stress or time dealing with them. Go to your local laundromat.I used them for about 6 months and was very satisfied and now the problems are way too frequent. First, there was an issue with them honoring a credit I earned for taking a survey. It took about 6 emails back and forth to get it resolved. It should've taken 2. It was simple. They were supposed to credit my card back. Never did. I stopped using them because of that. Used a local laundromat. Just used them again for the first time since and they were late picking up my laundry by an hour and now they have to reschedule my drop off because the ""concierge has an emergency"" and they can't add me back to the drop off list. Really Cleanly? They seriously need to hire a management company to help them work through the kinks and fix their operations issues because after paying $50 for wash and fold, my expectations, as the paying customer, is to get what I paid for. Plus, I waited on hold for 30 minutes just to speak with someone.Now, if and when I get my clothes, because I'm sure there will be another issue, since they always have issues, I will be deleting the app and will not be giving them a third time to screw me over."
6.0,0.2589,"Long and short of it, from pick up to cleaning, somewhere in the process, Cleanly lost my suit.  I reached out to their customer service when it became apparent something was awry, as the suit had not delivered 3 days after the delivery date.  I was told they could not locate the item, and they would initiate an inquiry in which they would give themselves 10 days to find the suit.After 10 days, I reached out again, having heard nothing from their POC, who let me know that if they could not find it, they would only compensate me for 10x the cost of cleaning (approx $150 dollars), not the actual replacement value of the suit.  That is about an $800 dollar difference between those two numbers, without tailoring or other factors included.  When I had Nordstroms reprint the receipt, provided tags, etc, and they did not feel that warranted a different review.  This policy is not located on their Ap, nor is it anywhere to be found when you agree to their pickup/delivery.  Seeing as they have were not proactive in identifying the issue, they were unwilling to volunteer information as to the status of the inquiry and totally unwilling to work with me to provide the replacement value for an item, I would not recommend using this service."

Thanks cleanly!  Trying to call them, they aren't picking up, shoc.  We've had issues before with them, this is the last straw. After calling and sending photos, they REFUSE to give us a refund!!!   UNBELIEVABLE"
3.0,0.2069,"Lost my whole bag of laundry! Called cleanly 4 times and got hung up each time. Messaged them and was told that my valet already dropped off with a ""doorman"". I live in a townhouse there's no doorman! When asked where they brought my clothes and how to get in contact with the person that dropped it off at the wrong address, they completely ignored my questions and just told me to wait. My valet never called, and I never found out where my clothes was brought or how they manage to loose a whole bag of clothes."
6.0,0.1861,The worst customer service! The first bad experience I had with this company was when their delivery was 24 hours late and didn't get reimbursed for the wasted time. 2nd time was when I recently got my laundry back and one of my expensive shirts were ruined. I contacted cleanly and told them the situation. They said unfortunately they can't reimburse me for the shirt that THEY damaged. I would definitely go with another company.
2.0,0.2758,"I want to love Cleanly, I really do, but this latest fiasco has made me delete the app. When they get it right, they get it right. It's one of the few places that you could (in theory) count on unscented laundry detergent if that was your selection. Since I have fragrance sensitivity, that's a big deal. So I've dealt with their semi-frequent annoying screw ups (washing in scented detergent, charging for things they shouldn't charge for pretty much every order, etc). When they get it wrong, through: forget it. I'm done.For the second time, their concierge just had an ""emergency"" and they canceled my pickup at the last minute. I had scheduled a pickup and drop-off in plenty of time to have clean clothes to pack for a trip. I get a text right before pickup time saying, gee, sorry, they had an emergency and changed my pickup time to *after* I will be living on my trip. A back-and-forth with customer service was useless. So now I have to take two hours off work tomorrow to do laundry that I could have dropped off somewhere if Cleanly hadn't run out the clock. They deserve to go under. The customer service is the pits. Find another laundry app."
2.0,0.3684,"I've been a loyal member for years. To echo other reviewers, it really has gone downhill the past 3-4 months.I share the same experience of not being able to contact customer service because they don't pick up, and them rescheduling my drop off literally at the end of the drop off time window.Right now I'm on yet another call (15 mins on hold) because I'm flying to Buffalo and then Canada tomorrow morning and they have rescheduled my 8-9pm drop off window tonight to the next day for absolutely no reason. Now I have no gym clothes and only one pair of jeans to last me a whole week of travel. And my jackets are also held hostage by them. This is insane. I planned my drop off tonight for a reason, but this is not the first time I needed clothes and had them reschedule on me at the last minute. It's the last straw. After hundreds of dollars with them, I'm moving into an apartment with a washer and dryer on 6/1 and ditching them forever. I suggest you do too."
0.0,0.1746,"Awful. They are CONSTANTLY losing your laundry. Terrible communication. I've had their customer service say, ""oh I remember you. We've lost your stuff before right?"" Seriously. Their delivery people will be the first to tell you how bad they are. I've used them for several months. Gave them more chances than anyone would. My only advice is just stay away. It's not worth it. One more thing, their excuse is that they are switching their delivery drives from ""consultants"" to full time employees. They have been using this excuse for MONTHS. Even the customer service rep I spoke to last time used it. And when I told her they always say that, she says d she knows and apologized again. Shame."
1.0,0.1792,"Horrible. I used them for a few months but have finally gotten fed up and decided to just go to a laundromat. tl;drTheir customer service is minimal, and you don't know what you've got til it's gone (with the clothing they lost)1) They provide no easy way to contact the people who are dropping off/picking up your clothes, so when they do things like forget to deliver some of your clothes, it becomes a huge ordeal to fix instead of a minor hassle. 2) They lost my clothes right before I went on vacation. Due to #1, this became a huge problem. That's also when I found out that their policy on their website is to reimburse you for no more than 10 times the cost of washing the item (cleanly.com/terms), which means the most you'll get back for a lost shirt that you ordered hang dry ($1 charge) is $10. 3) They provide no clear customer service information on their website. If you dig long and hard you can find a phone number on some page, but there are no customer service hours posted. You won't find out you're calling after hours until you're on hold with their inane hold music for an hour--when no one picks up, it just keeps you on hold forever. 4) They don't return the bags you send out. I used to get hang dry service, then the cleaners stopped returning the hang dry bags. When I eventually contacted customer service they told me they were no longer using hang dry bags, there's just a special pocket inside the normal laundry bag--but they didn't have any more normal bags they could deliver to me and wouldn't have them for another week or two.5) They're frequently delayed when delivering clothing and they need to reschedule, especially if you try to get them to deliver in the morning."
3.0,0.1961,"Astounding amount of waste for just a few dry cleaned shirts.

Build it and advertise it now and figure out how to actually make it function later.I will NEVER use Cleanly again and don't recommend it if you'd worry if your laundry goes missing. I had a HORRIBLE experience the first time I used them and would give zero stars if possible. Next time I will just drop off my laundry at the local laundromat down the street.Here's what happened: I paid extra for rush service. A friendly guy picked up the laundry on time in the morning and it was due back that evening between 8-9. At 8:25 I got a text that it had been delivered but it hadn't been. When I tried to call them to clarify, I was on hold for an hour. When a rep picked up, he heard my complaint and then pretended not to be able to hear me, like the connection was bad, and then hung up on me! I tried to use their chat support and the rep wasn't very helpful, saying the laundry had been delivered when it clearly was lost. Finally, he got word that the laundry was still in fact at their vendor's facility and couldn't be delivered until 8 PM the next day. (I had sent my bed sheets, so this was a huge bummer!)They then charged my credit card AGAIN for the new delivery and didn't cancel the first charge or refund the rush service fee.The customer service was AWFUL and unapologetic, and they're not reliable. I would only trust clothes/sheets I really don't care about seeing again with them."

They have since lost my dry cleaning and are extremely slow to respond via their customer service channels. They actually tried to hide the fact that the dry cleaning was misplaced by delaying the return of the full order. My laundry was returned 24 hours after it was promised, but the dry cleaning is no where to be found. What's worse, I've only received canned responses with multi-day lags between emails. In fact, I only got an acknowledgement of the problem after tweeting at them directly. It is now 8 days later, and I am still waiting for a response as to the two dresses that are lost. I understand that mistakes happen but their utter refusal to acknowledge the problem is utterly infuriating. I only want my items returned. Maybe by seeing this post the customer service team will actually respond to their email. Do not use this service."

2.0,0.4029,"I never write reviews, especially negative ones, but my experience was so overwhelmingly negative I feel the need to save other people the hassle. The entire purpose of this service is convenience but they fall well short of that. Save yourself the time, money, and stress. I work a lot, travel, and live alone so I wanted to try this out because I was rarely home when the laundromat near me is open - I leave home before 6 am and usually don't get back until after 8 or 9. Cleanly ended up making laundry even more frustrating. I'd rush back only to have them cancel my pick up. My ""hang dry"" clothes were returned soaking wet (like actually dripping). The app wouldn't acknowledge my change requests. My Cleanly bag and clothes were returned smelling like stale cigarettes. The final straw for me was this week after returning from a trip and desperately needing my laundry done before returning to work less than 12 hours after a long 36-hour trip home. I scheduled three different pick up windows and all were either cancelled (after an hour of waiting PAST the pickup window) or they didn't show up prompting me to cancel and be charged a fee. I was charged several times as a ""no show"" when I was home (concierge didn't even bother to follow the instructions for buzzing up to my apartment) and I only had one successful pick up / drop off in 2 months where I didn't have to reschedule more than once due to the concierge being late. I always tried to schedule pick ups before I leave for work and ended up being late when waiting for them to show up. Honestly can't say a single positive thing other than I am *fairly* certain none of my clothes were lost. Then again, I guess it's hard to lose them if you never come pick them up."
6.0,0.2796,"I've used Cleanly twice, once smoothly without a hitch and once as if I was in a never-ending nightmare of lost laundry. This is the story of the latter. Here's the summary: Cleanly picked up 2 bags of laundry from me, one with my shirts to be dry cleaned, another with laundry to be washed. I had 20-30 shirts and about 30-40lbs of wash and fold laundry (I suck at doing laundry regularly..hence trying Cleanly despite mixed reviews). A day goes by and I receive a text message (July 30) from the fulfillment center saying they can't immediately locate my laundry. Later, after an hour on the phone, Cleanly confirms that they've lost my bag with the 30-40lbs of wash and fold (thank god I didn't lose every dress shirt I've ever worn..trying to stay positive). They ask as ""corporate policy"" for a 10 business day time window to investigate during which they wouldn't even talk about reimbursement. I ask them to reimburse me at least for socks & underwear I have to buy to bridge me the 10 days...denied. Finally on Aug 16, I get a quote for reimbursement....at a rate of 10 times the cost to wash (ie. at the $1.50/lb rate for wash and fold, I would get $15 dollars for every pound of clothes lost). To put in perspective, this is the equivalent of a car wash compensating someone $150 for completely destroying/losing their car. If that wasn't enough, they quote me for 17lbs of clothes, ~ half of what the bag actually weighed. When I ask for specific internal documentation on the actual weight of the bag, Cleanly quickly attributed the prior weight quote as ""human error"" and agreed to compensate me for 30lbs, what I thought my clothes weighed in the first place. The question I would ask before using Cleanly are these - Is the convenience worth it for the risk of losing your entire wardrobe and receiving almost no compensation? Do you want to do business with a company that obviously tries to get away (fraudulently in the case of my weight quote) with paying less for reimbursement? As is always the case, you never see someone's true colors until things go south. My situation is still in dispute. I am currently seeking to file my case in New York Small Claims Court. My back-and-forth with Cleanly documenting the ordeal is below. You can decide for yourself if the risk is worth taking."

Now, I've been patiently waiting for the Cleanly person to come pick up my clothes. I got a notification that they're on the way. The tracker showed them about a mile away.

Yes, but that's beside the point.In all of this, they HAVEN'T REFUNDED THE ORDER. They took our $50, lost our clothes, did nothing for two weeks, ballparked the amount of stuff they lost, reminded us that their terms let them pay you chump change and then expected us to go, ""Well thanks for the effort!""No joke, this is the final line of the email they sent us.""I hope this is a positive solution.""Holy chriiiiiiist the audacity.

Even though it was only 30 min after the time slot, they couldn't pick it up until late that night.  Of course, that also meant my clothes wouldn't be back the next morning, but the next evening.  Annoying. Then, my doorman informed me that Cleanly took one bag, not both bags.  I got a text from Cleanly at 11pm (I was already asleep) because they were confused about what clothes to wash and hang dry.... since that was the bag they left at my building.  It's a stupid system of bags and they don't tell you that you're ""supposed"" to put the hang dry bag inside the wash/fold bag.  Gee, I figured having the bags on top of each other would make it obvious there were two. It was impossible to respond to the text, or click on the link it provided to clear things up.  Then I saw in the app that my delivery was delayed again to the next day (today).  So I emailed to explain and express my disappointment and irritation at the poor service and communication.

I've had all of my bedding and a significant number of clothes out for a cleaning and then been told that I would not be getting them back until 24-36 hours after I was scheduled to receive them. You don't get any sort of account credit for this, which is the least they could do.2. Customer service is basically non-existent. They have a phone number  which seems to always have an infinite wait time. They don't respond to customer support emails.3. For some reason their service has gotten worse this year: clothes are no longer folded properly, items are thrown together randomly instead of things like socks being kept together, and the benefits for the Cleanly Reserve membership were significantly reduced."

He said he called me when he was in front of the building, but was long gone now. I told him he couldn't possibly be far away because I called him back in two minutes, but he didn't care. He was also very rude and even hung up on me. I wish I would have read other reviews before trying this company out. Worst customer service I have received in years.

Because they forced me to shop around, I found good ol' WashClubNYC; who was waiting to provide this service as it should be.I didn't realize how bad even Cleanly's good days were, but now I see the light. After 3 months of using WashClub (about 15 orders, ordering from Brooklyn Heights), I have enjoyed:1. No missing clothing2. Regular weekly pickups, deliveries within a day (you can schedule morning of or night before without having to wait 2+ days for a pickup).3. A 'regulars' discount.4. Only 1 time, that service was delayed by a 12 hour window (night delivery was cancelled and they delivered next morning for me, delivery fee waved).5. Oxi-clean, color-safe-bleach, and cheaper rates!6. And last but certainly not least: COMPETENT, friendly couriers.

As a PSA, if they ruin an item (i.e. I recently had five pieces of dry cleaning accidentally put through the wash), they have an internal policy that dictates they can only refund you 10x the cost of cleaning. So if you get an expensive dress or tux dry cleaned and it gets damaged accidentally, they'll only reimburse you based on the cost to clean, not the value of the item. I wasn't aware of this till after having items damaged and I definitely wouldn't have given them those items to begin with had I know the policy. Have also had friends have their entire order misplaced and Cleanly requests 20 days to try and locate the lost order before beginning a reimbursement process... that's almost a month without your clothes back and no payment for the items you'll probably have to buy in the meantime."

As always, I made sure my order showed that there would be hand-dried (am I using this right tense with this?) items, but I thought something was off when I received my emailed bill later that night where it didn't include hang dry. After a quick call to confirm everything was okay and my clothes would be properly taken care of, they assured me all was fine. Unfortunately this was not the case when my laundry was returned and my shirts were not only shrunk, but pulled. After some back and forth, they offered me $70 (mind you there were two shirts ruined..around $400 retail price). I understand their policy under the circumstances where it would be the individuals fault for not properly addressing certain types of clothing, but I made it clear AND called customer service to confirm there would be no confusion. Such a shame. If anyone cares, I'm a size small in Rails long-sleeve button down flannel shirts. Ugh."

Dry cleaners have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the items entrusted to them, and if they fail to do so, consumers are entitled to seek recourse. Don't let Cleanly screw you over without a fight. Here are links for small claims court:nycourts.gov/courts/nyc... www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resourc...Also, you should use the ""International Fair Claims Guide for Consumer Textiles"" to build your case. It is a written standard drycleaners should hold themselves to. It will help you determine what they are liable for and how much you should be compensated for each item.Here is the link for the guide: gandwcleaners.com/Fair%2... (If the link doesn't work, you can just Google it)Lastly, while Cleanly's compensation policy for lost items limits compensation to 10x the cost of cleaning the item, that policy is incorporated in a limitation of liability clause.

In short, Cleanly is complete garbage.Here's a detailed timeline to provide a more tangible sense for their bullshit:* 6/30: Cleanly picked up my laundry as scheduled via the app (dry cleaning + wash & fold). * 7/2: This was the originally scheduled dropoff date, but they notified me 1 hour before scheduled delivery that they weren't able to make it, and automatically rescheduled for 7/3. I told them 7/3 wouldn't work because I was flying out of town for the week; Cleanly said tough shit, so I had to reschedule for when I was back in town on 7/8.* 7/8: Dropoff attempt #2-- Cleanly again failed to deliver during my scheduled window and tried to reschedule for some random time I wouldn't be home, so I had to reschedule for next day.* 7/9: Cleanly finally drops off my wash & fold, but my entire dry cleaning order is missing. I notify Cleanly via text and email immediately.* 7/26: 17 days pass of Cleanly claiming over email that they're looking for my order and also asking, 'durrrr, did you find your items?"" NO, BECAUSE THEY WERE NEVER DELIVERED. Finally they email me back on this day: ""It is our aim to resolve this matter as quickly as possible and we will have a supervisor contact you with reimbursement options in the next 3-5 business days.""* Today (9/1): Still haven't received a single communication from Cleanly since they told me they'd contact with reimbursement options, in spite of my email follow-ups and calls.Their phone line has put me on hold anywhere from 20-45min+ at a time before hanging up with an automated message claiming Support would contact me. Have they delivered on this promise? NOPE.Cleanly is totally unreliable and lacks any sort of accountability. Avoid them if you don't want them to reschedule your pickup/dropoff at the last moment and auto-reschedule you for some random window without regard for your schedule, then totally lose your belongings and ghost you without any recompense."

I contacted customer service and they rescheduled me for Saturday evening pickup, and Sunday evening drop off. Flash forward to Sunday evening, my street is closed off due to UN general assembly. I proactively reach out to Cleanly informing them of this and that I was even willing to meet the valet downstairs to pickup my laundry because I knew parking would be a challenge. NO RESPONSE from customer service. 30 minutes later, I see my valet is on the other side of town. After finally reaching customer service, they informed me that valet couldn't find parking and they had to reschedule the drop off. WTF, I had contacted them just to avoid this situation. After much firm language, they finally agree to send the valet back to drop off luggage but I had to go to the street corner to chase down my luggage.

This is hands down the worst cleaning experience I've ever had in a decade in NYC. They have messed up my orders several times - small missing items - hang dry items clearly not actually hung dry. I had added several discount codes to their app, and then they never honored them, but honestly I just let it go because I'm busy. It's obviously overpriced so I tried to use them rarely anyway, and now I know why there are so many bad reviews here. They ruined my expensive clothes last week - I added dry cleaning to a recent order (with hang dry items) and they ruined DRY CLEAN ONLY clothing. Expensive clothing unfortunately because that is what you dry clean. A $250 dollar dress, ruined. Another dress, way too shrunken to wear and can't be replaced. Countless others that were clearly marked in the dry cleaning bag. I'm heartbroken because two of the dresses just can't be replaced anymore. They also left an ink stain on a new skirt, I had just taken the tags off and worn once. Another ruined item. They have not responded to multiple emails and I can never get anyone on the phone. They destroyed my clothes, will not reimburse me, and Im telling you, use another service. I wish I had."

First of all, they were 45 minutes late with the delivery making my husband late for work. Then there were even bigger issues, they never returned or laundry bag and instead gave us a generic black one which I can only assume is another customer's. Eight pairs of my brand new underwear from Victoria's Secret came back completely torn (how does that happen??), and there was a pair of underwear that's not even mine in my laundry! When I contacted them about all the torn clothes, they said there was nothing they could do because I didn't indicate to dry on low heat, which I've never had to do in the past and had no issues. Plus how does slightly warmer heat completely tear clothes?! I don't know how they do laundry here but I definitely won't be using their service again."

(They didn't.)I then had an issue with a valet who called to say they were at my door an hour before my pickup time. I rushed to get there, and the valet was nowhere to be found and ignored my call back. I wrote into customer service, and got a ""we'll look into this issue"", but no actual resolve.On the same order as the valet issue, I got my order returned damaged, and wrote to them that I had to discard one of my items because it was beyond repair.

I set my alarm only to wake up to a message saying that they were beyond capacity so I'd need to reschedule for the next day. So I did, and woke up early again the next day, only to find out 40 minutes into the scheduled pickup that ""traffic is at a standstill, delivery is delayed by an hour."" Even though there was no traffic in the area on google maps. When I tried to get an actual ETA in reality it was 1.5 hours delay.  When asking for some kind of credit they offered me a measly $10.

I did not request express delivery, just having the extra two hours to work was what I needed. My laundry was delivered late (a common experience apparently) and I received no indication of this until 10 minutes before the original delivery window was supposed to end. Fortunately this wasnt the end of my world... but then the laundry they delivered wasn't even mine. I realized after the delivery guy left that I had a completely different person's bag, and when I called to try and get my belongings back the management said there was nothing they could do until the next day! They had all my sheets and I had absolutely no more clean work clothes left, so this was seriously a disaster. My delivery guy had texted me earlier thankfully, and apparently he still had my bag with him! Management said he wasn't allowed to return my belongings until the next day which made NO sense to either of us, and thankfully my deliverer was a reasonable human being who bent the rules to help me have a bed to sleep in and clothes to wear. THAT SAID, management instantly began to ignore me after I told them that their policy did not make sense, and I heard NOTHING from management until TWO DAYS later. If my delivery guy wasn't a literal angel I would have had the worst weekend possible!!! The company still hasn't picked up the incorrect delivery... and I feel so so bad for the girl whose things ended up at my apartment. If I were in her shoes this review would be WAAAAAY angrier.

3.0,0.2773,"First off, I just want to say I'm not a picky person. I think the laundering they do is great (when you get your clothes back), the folding is crisp, and the laundry bags they give out are hands-down the best laundry bags ever! I love the idea of on-demand laundry, and they had a good run for a bit, but I think they grew too big too fast and for the last 8 months they've had a 100% screw-up rate with my wife and I. We gave them several tries, and we stuck with it because it was so convenient in theory, but in the end the mistakes were too much of a headache to deal with.Over the last 8 months, at least one of the below happened EVERY time- they give us someone else's clothes and we need to call them back and schedule another pickup/delivery- they left something of ours on the delivery truck and forgot to bring it up with the rest of the stuff and we need to schedule another delivery ( which can suck if you timed washing your  bedsheets in the tiny window between guests. )- they give our clothes to someone else and/or just straight up lose them and we'll never see them again. ( This happened a few times so my wife and I got into the habit of taking photos of what we send off so we can keep track of if it comes back)My wife and I aren't fancy people, but the one time we both get some fancy shirts ( I know it's crazy for us to collectively drop $200 on two items of clothing, but sometimes it's worth it and of course they soon became our favorite shirts, because, duhhh) and we sent them off for a clean and hang dry, they both got lost. We showed them the photo proof of what we sent off to them, showed them the cost of the lost clothing from sites online where we bought it, but they could only cover up to $50. We wanted to cancel our subscription and get the rest of the year refunded, but they weren't into it. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. Which basically says to me, if you care about your clothes, or if you simply want some consistency, don't use Cleanly. Get to know your local laundromat. Be friends with them. Or get a washer/dryer."

""Per their policy"" they would only pay me 10x what it costs to launder an item, meaning they would pay me $125 for a $275 dress. I sent the link to the dress and asked if they would reimburse me for the actual cost of the item because I would need to replace it, and they told me that ""while they take responsibility"" they ""can't be sure they had the dress"" so they wouldn't be able to make an exception. Basically, you can't dry clean your expensive items and anything you launder should be less than about $30 because that is all they will pay you when they eventually lose something. This policy is absurd - I understand having a per item reimbursement cap but you lost the full item, I need to replace the full item, so this is nothing more than just a gesture.9/14 - cleanly lost my bathing suit top and after over three weeks and 15 business days (their policy is 10 and I checked in repeatedly and got ""we are still looking"" emails) they said the value of my bathing suit was $15 (it was NOT).

2.0,0.286,"I initially loved Cleanly, so much so that I invested in a reserve membership.  However, since I have been in central Brooklyn​ (even with the reserve membership), I have been notified via text on 3/4 orders that my order would be at least an hour late.  Cleanly provides a link to reschedule ""for free"" if your order is late, however rescheduling is not really free because (1) to get your laundry back at the originally scheduled time you'll have to pay extra if your order was originally a free, three-day turn around and (2) the link to reschedule sometimes is defective and doesn't provide rescheduling times. These issues would be fine IF there were a customer service staff to assist customers from the back end while the app continues to develop and de-bug. Unfortunately, this is possibly the worst aspect of Cleanly--I have attempted to call the company three times and always get placed on hold, disconnected, and then never called back.  I've tried waiting on hold and asking for a return call--neither yields a human on the phone.The unavailability of customer service is particularly troubling when it is 9:30 p.m. and you receive a notification that your pickup will be at least an hour late but you can ""reschedule for free,"" yet the text link only allows you to reschedule for a rush delivery fee. You'll get your laundry eventually, but plan for about a two day flex range unless you're ready to wait on pick-up or drop-off all night."
4.0,0.2923,"I used Cleanly many times with no issues from the time I first signed up until several months ago. I used to think it was a great service. However, in or around March of this year (2018) something changed and everything went downhill. I don't know whether there was a management change or whether the company is just incompetent but I recommend that you never use them. They will lose your expensive clothing, act like it's no big deal, and make you wait weeks for an answer. They also claim that customer service is available but they do not pick up the phone and it takes days to get a response to an e-mail. AVOID THIS COMPANY. SERIOUSLY!The first incident occurred in March of 2018. I sent out a very large wash and fold order and everything in the order could be machine washed. However, Cleanly unilaterally decided, without 1st consulting me, that some of the items needed to be dry-cleaned (they did not) and removed them from the wash and fold. Thereafter, all of these items (two pairs of pants and 10+ button-down shirts) went missing. I contacted the company and they were extremely slow to respond. It took multiple e-mails and phone calls and nobody would tell me what was going on other to say they were ""working on it."" Eventually, after two weeks of going back and forth, they finally located my items, but even then a pair of pants was still missing. While they eventually reimbursed me for this item, it was not before they accused me of being a liar and not sending the pants out in the first instance. They also refused to credit my account for all the hassles, merely offering me a 20% off discount on my next order. Thereafter, when I went I informed them I was deleting my account and that they should not charge me for the order, the begged me to give them a 2nd shot and told me to use the 20% off coupon and they would take special care to ensure this type of thing did not happen again and to properly inventory my clothing.Despite my better judgment (which I honestly should have followed), in April of 2018 I decided to give them one more chance. However, since I did not trust them for wash and fold, I decided I would send out my dry-cleaning to them (I had never previously had an issue with the dry-cleaning service). My dry-cleaning was picked up (4 items, two suit jackets and two suit paints i.e. two full suits) and the next day I received an invoice for only 3 items (2 jackets and 1 pair of pants). I immediately contacted the company. First, I received incorrect information from them. Then, when I called back they told me the item couldn't be deemed ""missing"" until after my other items were delivered and to call back when they were. They also said they would update me by e-mail but never did and tried to play it off as an ""invoicing error"" when in fact it was not. When the clothing was finally delivered, only 3 items were returned, but the hanger that the 4th item was on was IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DRY CLEANING BAG. As soon as I got the delivery, I asked the delivery guy what was going on. He shrugged and said he had no clue he was just the delivery person. I then attempted to call the company multiple times but nobody answers the phone causing me to wait on hold 3 times for over 30 minutes only to ultimately not be able to reach anyone. I also sent 2 emails and a Facebook message that as of now have gone unanswered. The pants that are missing were custom made and everyone at Cleanly continues to act like this is no big deal. In addition, they again accused me of not putting the pants into the bag as if they were trying to imply I was a liar. When all of this is said and done, I will be deleting my account permanently and never using Cleanly again. I recommend that you do not start using Cleanly if you are thinking about doing so and that you delete your account if you already have one, before something like this happens to you."

At 11PM I am not able contact anyone and my order is nowhere to be found. This is unacceptable, if you are making late deliveries make sure a customer service rep is present and make sure that the call back service is actually working. I have called multiple times during the week (during regular business hours) and only once did i get a call  back that got disconnected and no one called me back. I am sorry but this is very disappointing and frustrating."

The individuals who picked up and delivered my clothes were courteous, professional and timely. They were fantastic.However, my clothes, which I had asked to be washed in cold (they were all brights anyway so I'd assume they'd be washed in cold anyway) definitely weren't and now look very worn out.

I would send in laundry for their overnight service (which costs more) and they would send an email at midnight saying it won't be ready until the following day and that they rescheduled the delivery time for a different inconvenient time. They only deliver in the morning and evening so they state it's not even possible for them to fix the delay and deliver during the day. Don't use this laundry service. Also forget about trying to get ahold of them by phone, no one answers."

The second last time I used their service they rescheduled my return time twice. fine, I am ok with that.The very last time I used it in mid June, the delivery guy just said that my hangdry shirts are delayed. I immediately looked it up and emailed customer service right the way to check the status. After their ""10 business days of extensive search"" they declared that they have lost my shirts. I am not asking for too much, only hoping that they can reimburse me the cost of the clothes (they are tailor-made shirts btw).not only they couldn't match the cost, they could only reimburse me 10 times of the cost of washing the items. just $90 bucks for three shirts. so like what? I shouldn't do laundry with them for any item that's more than 30 bucks? anyway gonna be the last time using their service. so long, cleanly."

Be aware: Cleanly ships everything to the Bronx. It is obvious that the cleaner doesn't know the difference between a $300 sweatshirt and a $30 sweatshirt and frankly, I bet they don't care.

This discount was not applied to my order. Third problem: I messaged customer support about the issue with the invoice for my order. After sending a screenshot of the discount still showing in my Cleanly app, they stopped responding.

5.0,0.271,"I used Cleanly one time, my first time using a laundry service, and I will never be using one again. My clothes are predominantly black and white, making them exceptionally easy to sort. And yet, when I received my clothes back from Cleanly all of my whites were a dingy grey!!! I was absolutely floored that a professional laundry service would return my clothes in such a state. It was not a minor change in color, either: the clothes were completely unwearable. Not only that, but one of my air-dried white shirts that wasn't dirty at all when I gave it to them came back filthy, splashed and splattered with dirty water. (It was extremely humid and rainy on the day they returned them and the plastic over the clothes was ripped and scrunched around the top of the hanger.)Speaking of hang-dry items, take caution. They use wire hangers to do it, meaning you get shirts back completely misshapen and stretched out at the shoulders. Those were also unwearable.When I told Cleanly about these issues, they were nice and responsive, but insisted that let them try to fix the shirts before reimbursing me. That was obviously going to be a waste of time, and it was. Those clothes came back in the same condition (including the shirt they got dirty...still dirty). The blacks they were redoing due to the misshapenness came back with white detergent all over them, so were again unwearable. The smell of detergent on everything was actually overpowering.I was reimbursed for the shirts, but only up to 10x the cost of washing the specific clothes that were ruined. That was about $75 total for 6-7 shirts. Clearly not sufficient to replace what was ruined. They also only reimbursed for the order cost of the shirts they ruined, not the entire order.Based on other reviews, I think I just had horrible luck. Customer service was very responsive and as helpful as they could be within their policies."
2.0,0.2572,"STAY AWAY! The service has drastically gotten worse. They promote that they separate colors and whites and my white sweatshirt came back with blue spots all over it. They make you submit a picture that the tag says to wash separately- which it did- but either way that shouldn't matter as this is already described in the service. When I asked for reimbursement they ignored and asked if they could try to re-wash it. You select a time slot for pick ups and drop offs- they are rarely on time. I've had them show up 40 minutes early OR over an hour late. Whats the point of schedules when I cant plan around it? This week:Monday- Pick up cancelledTuesday- Late Pick upWednesday- 1.5 hour late drop off, they tell you that you can reschedule and wont be charged the rescheduling fee- I got charged anywayWednesday evening- Rescheduled drop off is cancelledI asked for a refund and I got $10 off of a $70 dollar order. I will NEVER be using this service again- my boyfriend and i have been loyal customers. Take accountability and research the meaning behind good customer service. Oh and did I mention I was just on hold for 45 minutes just for their automated voice to say ""sorry we cant help you right now call back later?"""
2.0,0.2965,"I want to like Cleanly, but they just won't let me. It seems like every time I open the app, there are no pickup times available until the next day. OK, not the end of the world, but as a business traveler, I sometimes just need my clothes cleaned that day. So I finally planned ahead enough one week to schedule a Cleanly pickup the next evening. There's a 3% discount for leaving laundry with your doorman, and since I was in a hotel, that was going to be easy. The app told me my pickup would happen before 7pm, but then I got a text saying it would be between 7-10pm (weird). I left my laundry with the front desk the next morning, with clear instructions in the app to pickup from there.Fast forward to the next night. It's 10:30pm, and I'm out when I get a text that just says ""the gentleman at the front desk refuse to look for your clothes"". I replied asking if this was Cleanly, but got no response. Annoyed, I head back to my hotel to talk to the front desk. Turns out the pickup guy said that he was picking up clothes from my room. The front desk called my room twice (but of course I wasn't there). They then suggested the pickup guy call me, to which he responded to them ""I'll just mark is as a no show."" Of course since it was a different person at the front desk, they didn't know my clothes were just sitting in the luggage room.This will probably be my last attempt at using Cleanly. Their support section in the app also just gives a general ""network error"" when you click it too, thus the airing of grievances on Yelp. Rinse (a similar service in SF) has worked seamlessly for me, so Cleanly has just been a huge failure.C an't seem to get their scheduling right.L ack of communication from the pickup guy.E rror messages in the app.A nnoying overall experience.N ever seem to have earlier pickup windows.L ocal laundry places are more effective.Y ou're better off just hiring a courier or TaskRabbit."

Good quality cleaning, and responsive support staff. But something has gone seriously wrong over the past few months.The cleaning service has gone substantially downhill, with clothes beginning to come back feeling less ""fresh"", more frequently damaged, and often not even properly pressed. Making matters dramatically worse, I sent in a big bunch of clothing a couple weeks ago - an almost $300 order. And Cleanly managed to lose a substantial portion of it. I reached out immediately, and have received a bunch of not-so-apologetic form letters in return, apologizing for the ""inconvenience"". They claim to be searching for the items, but days go by without any updates. I even emailed the chief executive, who couldn't be bothered to respond.Losing a loyal customer's clothing is bad enough, but the cavalier response shows a complete lack of care for customers' belongings. I note that another user just days ago reported he same issue. Caveat emptor."

This is the 2nd time, not the first, the SECOND time Cleanly has failed to deliver my laundry and dry cleaning orders back to me during the specified time, or even the specified DAY I scheduled the drop off for. The first time it took DAYS to hear even a peep from cleanly as to where my personal property was after they missed their delivery window. After being talked down by the manager, Torva, who assured me she would personally be keeping an eye on my orders going forward, I decided to keep using Cleanly.Flash forward a couple months to my current order, scheduled to be picked up Friday AM, dropped off Sunday PM. Pick up goes off without a hitch, then Sunday night I get a text saying something happened with my valet and they are unable to deliver my order - it will be rescheduled for the next available time. I replied to the text, called the office and emailed the ""support"" email several times that night and heard nothing- CRICKETS. I stayed on hold for almost an hour- no answer- no answering service that says they are closed- NOTHING.I call the next morning and finally reach someone, who confirms my order has been rescheduled for the soonest time I can actually be present to receive it - that evening.  The representative I spoke with confirms the day/time via email as well.That evening I check the app, just to double confirm, and IT IS SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT DAY. After speaking with several representatives that evening everyone tells me a different story. I finally speak with the manager Torva, again, and confirm with her that since this evening is obviously shot it has to be delivered the following morning, before I leave for work. She confirms. We hang up.The morning rolls around, I get a text saying my laundry will be delivered as discussed, and then NOTHING. My personal property (with items I needed since Sunday evening and it is now a Tuesday) are STILL no where to be found. I called the number again and was on hold for 30 minutes and NOTHING.

Seeing that I was very unfamiliar app I had included a lot of errors in my pickup order including what kind of services I wanted and how I wanted them to be done. As a result I had to cancel that order immediately and proceeded to create another order. What I didn't realize was that even though I had cancelled my order almost immediately after I had created it, I would be charged for doing so. I came to realize this a few days later. Second of all, I had scheduled for my laundry to be picked up on a Sunday night and I purposely stayed in my room during the time selected to wait for the service to come and pick up my clothes. However, when the time had come no attempt to reach out to me had been made, but when I decided to check my app order had been automatically cancelled and a 5 dollar cancellation fee had been charged to my card. Seeing all the other bad reviews on here I can only assume this is the only way they have been making money lately, false cancellation charges, without any efforts of communication. I will definitely not be using this service again and it sucks because it creates a lot of doubt for other services similar to this that might not be as shady.

AVOID CLEANLY AT ALL COSTS.Our experience with Cleanly has been a completely Kafkaesque nightmare.We gave them a bag of laundry (containing almost all of my girlfriend's clothes) and a good amount of dry cleaning. We were excited to try the service, hoping that it would save us the inconvenience of walking our laundry down the block to do ourselves.Cleanly lost ALL the laundry we gave them, and returned the dry cleaning with severely damaged or lost items. The suit I gave them came back with a 1+ inch hole in the arm. How could that even happen? My girlfriend's Marc Jacobs ski jacket had the fur lining completely lost.We then repeatedly called Cleanly's customer service line, without any answer for days. When we finally started receiving responses to our emails (still no calls), the responses made it feel like losing all of a customer's items was completely routine for them. They refused to tell us anything about whether we would be refunded for the service or reimbursed for our lost and damaged items. They also refused to tell us anything they had done to try and find our clothes, despite multiple emails asking.Finally, longer than TWO WEEKS later, and after HOURS of wasted time, we received a response that actually addressed our issues in any way. Our laundry had been found (supposedly), but the fur lining was still lost and they would not reimburse me for the full value of the suit they destroyed.When I stated that I wanted the full value of the suit, or would look at legal avenues, they threatened to cut off all communication (implicitly threatening that they would hold our lost laundry they still have as a ransom).Quixotically hoping that we receive our clothes back and get reimbursed for the inexplicable damage Cleanly caused to my suit. Cleanly has been a complete and total nightmare. Instead of cleaning our clothes conveniently it was lost and damaged. Avoid Cleanly at all costs. Our experience was NOT an isolated incident.

I was a very happy dry cleaning customer with The Dhobi who got bought by Cleanly and, after using them twice, I can say they are nothing like The Dhobi and I will never use them again.My biggest dislike of Cleanly is they refuse to return my items without plastic. Really? It's 2017. Being environmentally conscious is ""in"". Every customer has their own bag so putting everything in plastic and then in the bag is silly.Second, the Cleanly pickup/drop off bags are so cheap and impractical compared to The Dhobi, who used the Green Garmento (from shark tank). This bag converted from a laundry bag when items were dirty into a garment bag when they were clean. The Cleanly bag is *only* a garment bag so it's really awkward to fill and load with dirty items.Lastly, they refused to dry clean one of my items. It's a jacket where the snap ripped through the fabric on one pocket. It's been there for years and other companies have dry cleaned it no problem. They didn't give me an option to clean it.

Oh, they also make sure to include a link to their usage terms, where they tell you that the max reimbursement for a shirt is aprox. $45 (which of course, doesn't cover even half of the cost to replace the shirts).I wish I've read these reviews before trying it in the first place.

Look on LinkedIn for people who work at Cleanly and send them messages about your issue. Barrage them with this info.4. Tweet about your experience. Send a direct message on twitter to or about Cleanly ( @cleanly)5. Continue to update your experiences on Yelp6.

(Originally Thursday at 6:30 am, then Friday, then Saturday midday) With no notification, email, or way to contact them!!  So frustrating, and now I'll be running around to buy socks and underwear before going out of town for the weekend...? Awesome."
2.0,0.1828,"Cleanly has been getting worse since my last review. I think they have acquired more customers and they just cannot find a way to handle more customers. The issues I have now is that they often show up 20-30 mins late behind their 1 hour window. And it took them longer to finish the laundry. As a result, they send my laundry back 1-2 day later than the schedule day like every the other week. And I always do my laundry during weekends this always cause problems as I won't have clothing for work or workout."

However, the last & final time I used Cleanly--the service ""rescheduled"" my delivery for an entire week with 0 updates on where my items were or when they would be delivered. All attempts at contacting Cleanly were met with scripted representatives. I have worked with the BBB to remedy this last issue, but the BBB is also having trouble contacting Cleanly. A truly awful service."
2.0,0.2026,"Seriously THE WORST.  This app/service deserves a special place in the devil's basement.  I rarely write reviews but when I do, it's well deserved.  Most of the terrible things are summed up in other reviews but I'll give a brief summary of my experiences:1: They have never once been on time for a pick-up, drop off.  I understand NYC has traffic, but you have an HOUR window, I have had drivers 3+ hours late.  They allow you to reschedule but only in their preselected time slots which are normally days later; they also don't give you the option to cancel.  The sad part is, if you start a new order there are literally 10+ time slots to choose from; so they will take on new customers but not take care of the orders they already have.2: Customer service is a JOKE.  I have waited weeks for responses.  90% of the time if/when they respond they don't have a clue what they are talking about or don't resolve your issue.  I haven't tried calling but I've heard this is a special kind of experience. 3: The final straw, when they ruined/lost four brand new shirts from Bloomingdales.  Originally they were returned to me with red stains all over them.  I allowed them to take the shirts back to try and remove the stains.  Over a month later and many email communications, I was informed that they could not locate my shirts and they were refunding my money based on the weight.  They gave me about $40 for shirts that cost me over $130.  I even had pictures of each shirt (from when they were returned with stains) along with purchase receipts.  Then to add insult, they offered me laundry credit.  NO WAY will I ever use your service again, even if it's free.Do yourself a favor and skip this service, I GUARANTEE you will be dissapointed."
6.0,0.2113,"Nope nope nope. We have been using Cleanly for dry cleaning for a few months, and in that time, they have often missed our delivery by a day or two beyond our scheduled time. Last night, they straight up lost two of my husband's dress shirts, one of which was custom-made. We still don't have them back, nor do we have any answers about what happened.They are impossible to get a hold of if you need to tell them about a problem or ask a question, and when they occasionally do answer the phone, it's an uninformed idiot who doesn't know anything.The delivery people sometimes show up in pairs like they're on their way out for the night, wearing no identification or uniform. Every time we hand them our clothes, my husband wonders if we're getting them back. Don't use this service.*********************************UPDATE: My husband just discovered three more shirts from a PREVIOUS order are also missing. This is now a pattern, not a mistake. And interestingly, the only missing shirts are the patterned, fashionable ones - we haven't lost any plain white shirts. Just the expensive, custom-made shirts that would be hard to find in a store."
2.0,0.2436,"I want to write a nasty review, but they did resolve my issue... (even though it was quite the hassle for me.) They lost my bath towels... no biggie. I figured I would just email them and let them know, and they would just make a separate trip to drop them off once they were aware they lost them.Wrong.They require 7 days to find (why not just go back to where the order was filled and look there?) lost items. I had put everyone of my bath towels in there, meaning I had nothing to dry myself with after a shower. I know it's not the end of the world, but still a pretty big annoyance and something I didn't expect to happen when sending them all my laundry. On the 8th day of them looking for my towels, they finally found them. They said they'd be delivered between 7 and 8. I pushed back the time of an obligation I had to stay home and wait. But, they never came and I had to leave at 8, so I left. I was only five minutes down the street when they called and said they were there (15 mins late). I apologized and said I HAD to be somewhere and since they were late, I left - but I can be back at my door in five minutes. The delivery guy gave me the biggest attitude as if he couldn't wait just five minutes (when HE was late.) To avoid losing my towels AGAIN, I sprinted back to my apartment and met him. He shoved the towels and me and walked away. So rude. I didn't necessarily mind they were late, it ended up working out fine, but his attitude soured an already frustrating situation. Not only did Cleanly lose my towels, it took them 8 days to find them, the delivery guy was late and then got mad at me for having to maintain my personal obligations instead of sitting inside waiting for a LATE delivery guy. My clothes (and late towels) did arrive clean, folded nicely, and smelling good. Cleanly customer service also responded in a timely manner and did solve my problem. (Although it just shouldn't have happened in the first place, or been resolved much quicker.) I'd recommend using this service at your own risk because if there are no hiccups in your order, the service is convenient and helpful."
3.0,0.242,"Terrible experience. I had a washer and dryer in my NYC apartment for the past 4 years and recently moved into a spot without one. I didn't realize that I valued that washer and dryer more than space. Hence, after lugging laundry up and down 4 flights of stairs for a few months I decided there is probably an app for that.Cleanly came the first time and gave me some fancy bags. Then, they clocked in my order. They overcharged me for not one, but two comfortors at $25 a pop that were not in my laundry bag. WTF. After some emails with a fresh customer service person, they removed the charges. Then the laundry came back. A little dingy, and still with a faint smell of BO on my boyfriend's gym clothes.Why did I try again? I wish I didn't. Maybe I was giving them the benefit of the doubt out of sheer laziness. Even if they kinda sucked the first time.The second time around they really outdid themselves. They lost expensive clothes and linens. And those are just the ones we noticed. Who knew you should itemize and photograph your laundry that goes out. Hey guy packing the hang-dry bag, did you realize there were 5 items on the tag and only 4 in the bag? And that the 30-pound bag that was picked up was only like half as heavy as that when it was going back? That's weird, right? Are you wearing my jeans?They don't kinda suck, they royally suck. First impressions are usually on point. Don't use this service."
5.0,0.2193,My building doesn't have laundry and I finally got tired of having to schlep all my stuff to the laundry mat. I was nervous to try cleanly however I decided to give it a shot and I regret it. My first order with them was for sheets and towels and one of my sheets came back with a large tear and rip. These sheets have been washed for 9 months at the local laundromat and I've never had an issue. It's obvious that the laundry is being done quickly and a sloppy manner. I decided to give them one more chance with a second wash of my workout clothes. I just got them back and again there is damage. The metal piece at the end of the drawstring was ripped off. Whatever machines they are using and the methods are clearly very damaging to clothing. I've contacted support and I'm waiting for their response.
4.0,0.2307,"Sadly, all of a sudden in December I received an email from Cleanly saying that they were making their ""Valets"" or delivery/pickup personnel staff and that it would be so much better. Well, not so. Now, you have to book days in advance with few time slots available. They valets are consistently extremely late and rushed. They are still very nice and very polite like always, but you just can't rely on the service anymore. I have a sneaking suspicion that the company changed the pay or hours or something for their valets and that a bunch of them quit. It's really too bad because I was sooooo happy with them before. But I can't be an hour late to work because I am waiting for someone to pick up my laundry!"

They are also refusing to compensate anywhere near what the items cost, despite losing two items in two consecutive orders. They clearly do not care about customer service or experience. I had to wait 10 business days to hear back from them to say it was lost. For the first item they offered cleanly credits and I was tempted to give them a second chance - what a terrible idea. They then lost my coat from my second order and will only compensate $140 for a $1200 coat... nowhere close to value and nothing was added to the base compensation rate as good will, given that this is the second item they lost. fool me once shame on them, fool me twice.. shame on me i guess.Additionally, the last item was clearly stolen as the hanger was in the bottom of the garment bag that they provided to deliver clothes back in and my building as already reviewed security footage to establish it wasn't taken inside the building by doormen. Looking at options to recover more of my losses. Would not recommend this service to anyone. Please beware."
4.0,0.3227,"My new building doesn't have a washer/dryer, so I decided to give Cleanly a try when I found a coupon code for $10 off. This was my first time using a laundry pick-up/delivery service. My boyfriend and I packed two large bags full of laundry. The Cleanly app was very easy to use, and the pick-up valet showed up on time. He didn't have the Cleanly bags advertised by the company, but I assumed that wasn't a big deal (this being my first time) and gave my laundry to him in trash bags. The next day, when my laundry was supposed to be delivered, I get a text saying there was a delay. No big deal - I rescheduled the delivery. When the second delivery time rolled around, I got a text saying my laundry was on the way and I could track the deliveryman on my phone. A few minutes after the little tracking dot reached my apartment, I got an e-mail from Cleanly saying I had missed my laundry pick-up but they would waive the fee since it was my first time. What?!? I refreshed my phone, and the tracking information for my delivery disappeared, saying tracking was no longer available. A few minutes after that, my laundry order completely disappeared from my Cleanly account on the app. I contacted Cleanly immediately after this, and they said there was nothing invoiced on my order and it appeared my laundry was missing. It's been nearly two weeks since the pick-up day, and I still haven't seen my laundry. Cleanly has apologized and said they're searching for my stuff. They also e-mailed once, asking if a picture (attached to the e-mail) showed my items. It did not. I'm extremely frustrated, as those two trash bags were stuffed full of laundry. I don't even know what all we lost. However, amongst the losses, we do know there was a duvet cover, sheets, a mattress cover, heaps of socks and underwear, my favorite blanket, my boyfriend's favorite jacket, several shirts, and more. At this point, I'm doubtful Cleanly will be able to find my laundry. They did say they will reimburse me if they can't find the items. Even if they do find them, I hope they don't dare charge me for the washing. After all this stress/frustration (not to mention needing to buy new socks/underwear because I gave Cleanly all of mine), I don't think I owe them anything. I'll update this review when Cleanly either returns my laundry or reimburses me for the loss.UPDATE: After three weeks, Cleanly found my laundry and returned it to me. The delivery wasn't flawless - the delivery person accidentally dropped it off in front of my neighbor's door but called immediately once she realized the mistake. I'm happy to report that Cleanly did not charge me for the order. If anyone's thinking of using Cleanly, I would highly advise that you do not give them anything of value to you."

I, for one, am a sucker for aesthetics. So I get it. I just tried Cleanly two days ago for the first time. I live out of only two suitcases so I was super concerned giving my clothes way. The kindest delivery person assured me they have a process in place for that. Yesterday, not only did I receive someone else's laundry, I didn't receive a single piece of my own. MY ENTIRE BAG OF LAUNDRY (which is about 90% of my entire wardrobe including ALL of my bedding) is GONE and because the ticket still says my name, I have some poor person's laundry bag instead, and there's nothing they can do. This is a mortifying experience. They do not have 24 customer service, it's all in email, and they refuse to call. Do yourself a favor and walk to the laundromat yourself.

I was supposed to finally get them this morning, but a few minutes ago I got a surprise text telling me that I'd need to be home at 9pm to receive the order.

They are also CHEAP on their refunds and never seem sorry when they screw up your order. Most recently, they forgot to deliver 7 hang dry items (over $500 value of clothes) and they couldn't even respond to me. The whole point of having someone deliver your laundry is to be more convenient, but they are always late and the peace of mind that all your clothes will return is not worth the cost.

They took quite a while to search for the missing lingerie bags, ultimately didn't find them, and reimbursed me a fraction of the cost of replacing my underwear collection. They say that the ""industry standard"" is to reimburse by the weight of the lost items. They weren't amenable to my argument that losing *every* *pair* of underwear someone owns is a qualitatively different mistake from losing a single garment--if in no other way than it puts an immediate financial burden on the customer to replace the underwear. They were perfectly pleasant to me on the phone, but they didn't--and, I suspect, won't--address the conditions that made this mistake possible in the first place. They are not bringing their operation to scale slowly and responsibly. They're outsourcing to too many different facilities, not managing their relationships with those facilities, and not creating the channels of communication necessary to hold them accountable for delivering the level of service customers expect. Which, of course, includes not losing *every* *pair* of underwear a customer owns.

So they told me that now my laundry would all be delayed until Thursday and I needed to create a new order for the dry cleaning through the app. I told them okay I did please make sure no one shows up as you already have the item. Sure enough at 7am Tuesday someone shows up and I wasn't available so I got marked as a no show, which they did remove from my record but it was a complete waste of that guys time.

Customer service got back to me within a day and offered to re-clean the items for free. We did that, but the clothes came back looking exactly the same. I reached out to customer service again and they offered me either Cleanly credit or cash per their damage policy (up to 10 x the weight of the items). I changed my review to two stars because they did reimburse me and were generally pretty responsive and pleasant. But the reimbursement didn't cover the original cost of the clothes, some of which were pretty new. And I wouldn't take the risk of using them again, unfortunately. But it was something at least."

As my responsibilities in life increase and my time has shorten I was left with no choice to have my laundry do by someone, ""professionally"". One of the many companies that came up in my search was cleanly. I decided to take a chance with Cleanly. The service was mediocre but it did the job. As time went on, I began missing socks, underwear, shirts, etc.; to even getting other peoples clothing. As time went on, I went from losing or gaining clothing articles to losing an entire bag of cloths. The valet-delivery people are just as unprofessional and rude as the people are at the call center, when I made my claim. No one should subject to missing clothes and their unprofessional tone and language. To say the least, I will not be a customer after they lost an entire bag. I can't see this company lasting long.

During my laundry pickup window, at the last minute while I was already home waiting, I got a notification saying that due to a ""driver emergency"" they wouldn't be able to complete my pickup and automatically rescheduled my pickup for two DAYS later. I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Then when I used it again a month later, the exact same thing happened due to a ""driver emergency,"" except this time right before I was leaving for a ten day trip. I was able to get it rescheduled for that night, changed my plans to be home for it, and then they were still 30 mins late after the window.

What's worse than that - you then have to chase customer service for help. I sit forever on hold during the few hours they are actually ""open"" and never get through to a person.

I had a wash & fold order scheduled to be delivered on Wednesday, August 9 in the evening. It was dropped off on time, but when I went through it, they had not included ALL of my undergarments (bras, underwear, socks). Unfortunately, this is not like they misplaced a dress and I could just wear a different one. To make matters worse, I was on an 8am flight the next day and would be out of town for the next week. Once I emailed/called/stalked customer service, they were able to locate all of my items the next day, but because I was out of town, I had to purchase some new undergarments to last me the next week, which they refused to reimburse me for. Instead, they told me that they 'can wash my missing garments and deliver them for free'. It's not free if I've already paid for them and you're now just delivering them 7 days late. Finally, after I asked them, they reimburse me for the wash and fold that I paid for. I then schedule them to be delivered the next week on Thursday evening when I'm back in town.On the day that my lost items are supposed to be returned, they email me an hour and a half before delivery that 'due to needing more cleaning' my items will now be delivered the next day. More time? They've had them for over a week. I call customer service AGAIN to tell them that I this is unacceptable and I need my items delivered that night as originally scheduled. She tells me that my items can 'probably' be delivered tonight, but they won't be clean. When they finally get delivered at 11pm, they smell like mold. I'm pretty sure they washed them the week prior and then just left them sitting for days just damp, which doesn't give me confidence in their service. Throughout this entire process, they barley apologized and never offered any sort of make-good on their behalf. Such a disappointing and terrible customer experience. Use at your own risk."

Expensive--but sweet app, tight delivery, premium quality bags, and hang dry service.  My last order, unfortunately, was a total misfire: - It came in 25 minutes after the delivery window, with no notification that he'd be late. Not the end of the world, but an inconvenient start to the day. - They included some nice lingerie that weren't mine, so I had to wait another 45 minutes for the guy to come back. - And clear signs of bleach damage to two (very nice) articles of clothing. I checked on here to see if this was an isolated incident and, nope, plenty of reviewers (especially more recent ones) have run into similar issues. These aren't starting-out kinks, these are quality control issues. This smells awfully like yet another startup tossing out customer experience in favor of scale. That sucks. The beautiful app, the cute ""valet"" concept, the subscription package... those are all nice... but without consistent delivery on the experience, it's all so much fluff. I'm just going to use my neighborhood place from now on."

They mentioned they needed 1 full week to search for it which I thought was pretty ridiculous. The second time I was guaranteed pick up from my hotel on a Fri evening and a return the following morning. Then I received a call late Fri evening after the pick up with some pointless queries to confirm my order which I thought was a waste of time as this was all confirmed online with my order which is pretty dummy proof. It was then confirmed that some of my laundry would  make it back Sat morning and the balance on Sat evening. Then on Sat evening I received another call only to be informed the balance  of laundry  would arrive Sun morning. And an email on Sunday afternoon stating it would not be finished till a few days later. Absolutely ridiculous especially given I made it clear right from the start my flight back overseas was Sunday evening and I would only put the order through if they could guarantee a return before my departure!..  Since I have returned back to my home country  I have tried to get in touch and emailed Cleanly several times trying to resolve my two issues above but received  no response whatsoever!.. This is contrary to the swift response I received from them when enquiring about a potential order. My observations of Cleanly:- I get a strong impression that they do not even do the laundry directly and are an outsource business who outsource to numerous providers whom they seem to have no control over leading to my issues above-  unprofessional - do not ever answer their hotline and it always goes to an answering machine. They  only return calls if it is at their convenience and suits them. -I question if they  have a professional office as it is probably run by one person from a home garage, with an outsourced call centre and a network of outsourced local Laundromats .Following my recent issues with Cleanly I am yet to receive any response from them after numerous attempts. My next course of action is reporting them to the local Police and Consumer Affairs. Businesses like these need to be SHUT DOWN!...I wish I had just went to the local laundry service down the road who I could see, feel and touch. I hope no one ever has to go through my experience."

This was completely their fault. Initially, they said they were going to compensate for the damaged item. Then a few days later, they said there is nothing they can do other than giving me $50 credit. Seriously? Do they really think I will take that petty amount of credit and keep being a happy customer?

I was livid. How can a cleaning served be so bad at simply cleaning the pieces as instructed. They told me the reason my sweater is lost is because the material was cashmere, which is absolutely ridiculous. The price of the sweater was about $300 and they only reimbursed me 1/4 of it. I'm still waiting to hear back about my pants. If I could give Cleanly negative stars, I would. PLEASE avoid.

That was until the last month or so during which they  stained several of my items, returned smelly clothes and then lost several hundred dollars worth of clothing. All this when I had paid extra for their ""Reserve"" membership. I suspect their quality has dropped due to expansion. When the reimbursement they offered was only a fraction of what the clothes they lost were worth, I asked them to cancel the annual Reserve membership. They told me that I was too far into the year to receive any sort of refund. I've only been a member since July...Reading another poster's review below, it also appears they offer higher reimbursements once folks post negative reviews online. They wrote to me, ""our goal is to make our reimbursement policy as fair as possible."" This hardly strikes me as fair."

Nevertheless, the next day the clothes were delivered, perfectly fine, smelled wonderful and neatly folded...then I put in my second order. This time the clothes returned not smelling of anything and they literally had melted all of my panties. Panties that have been through the wash before, melted!

1.0,0.3656,"Multiple time user here. The first few times the service were adequate, although on my most recent dry-cleaning order not only did they HANG my sweaters (one of which was a Missoni cardigan, which now has delightful hanger bumps,) but everything came back smelling of chemicals. I had to air out my coats and jackets before putting them in my closet. My most recent order for wash and fold was a nightmare. The order was picked up promptly in the morning and scheduled for same day delivery, but a few hours after sending out my order I received an email stating that my order would be delayed because they didn't know how to wash the stuff (which honestly was underwear and a bathmat, pretty straightforward.) I responded to them that I would accept the delay and told them when to next deliver it. Another few hours go by and I receive a text AND another email saying they still don't know what to do with my stuff, and that they were holding it until I decided (making it seem like the delay is my fault, right?) I send out ANOTHER email telling them I had already replied with instructions. Then I receive ANOTHER text telling me that they STILL don't know what to do. By this point there's no way my order will be done on time. I sent them a total of four emails before I called them (during their very limited phone hours) to explain the situation. To their credit, the woman who picked up was apologetic, but that didn't change the fact that their email system is broken and no one in their company cares enough to fix it. My email inbox is littered with Cleanly spam because every time I sent an email, I would receive an automatic response stating that their server wasn't accepting requests. I would then get another email a few days later saying the attempted email has failed permanently. SO, basically Cleanly can email you but you can't email them back. They will then hold your clothes until you can call them. Great system right?Okay so I finally receive my order and guess what? My white Matouk bathmat (which cost a hefty sum) is not only fraying, but a dingy grey with BLUE STAINS from unwashed detergent. The quality of the order was pathetically bad, given the fact that they had TWO EXTRA DAYS to fix it. In sum, not only was my order horribly delayed and Cleanly a pain in the neck to get a hold of, by the time I finally received it my items were stained and still damp, in even worse condition ""clean"" than they were dirty! I am currently trying to have them rewash my bathmat, and the same unresponsiveness has made this process take DAYS. My bathmat is still stained."
5.0,0.2937,"I sent the below email to Cleanly customer support one month ago. No one ever even responded, which is why ultimately this review is 1 star. ==========Hi Cleanly,I have been a customer for over a year.  For the first 6 months, I was thrilled with your service.  I always selected the options for unscented detergent and no fabric softener, and Cleanly complied. I have spent over $600 with you in the past year and recommended many friends.Then in December 2015, my order came back intensely scented with fabric softener (doesn't smell like Tide).  Your customer service was responsive and picked it up to rewash it.  But ever since, it has been very hit or miss.  Sometimes it's unscented, sometimes scented.  Sometimes half the wash is scented and half not.  Customer support is always apologetic, and they give me a $5 credit or whatever, but I have clothing in my closet that I'm reluctant to wear because it smells so sickly sweet, and for months (I guess the promises in the commercials are true).My most recent order was two blankets and some towels.  It was so heavily scented that I had to take it to a friend's apartment who has a balcony to air it out.  Before I even explained to the friend what I was doing there with my laundry, he said ""Ugh, that stuff stinks!"" I have asked customer service to look into why this happens--whether it was a new laundry facility you started using in December, a staff person not reading the instructions, or what.  But at this point, I just don't feel that I can rely on Cleanly anymore to follow my request--a simple request I'd think, since it's an option in your app.I will continue to recommend your service to people who don't care about scented laundry, but I will have to find another option for myself.  I'm still holding out hope that you will be able to sort this out and offer me some kind of explanation to give me confidence again, but for now, so long.Sincerely,Elizabeth"

Second Time:- Valet cancelled on me for a ""no-show"" - I live in a doorman building and never got a buzz, and no call on my phone- I contacted Cleanly and they decided to reschedule my pickup for the hour after my original - a time that wasn't convenient for me, when they didn't even ask permission- Valet cancelled on me for a ""no-show"" again, although still no buzz or call, and I got charged another fee- I contacted Cleanly again and they credited me back the $5, but I feel like I deserve more compensation! The actual washing and drying has been fine - granted I do send my $hit clothes there only, gym things, t shirts, sweatpants, loungewear that I don't care about.

I contacted Cleanly and only after almost 6 hours of being on hold with the company did my boyfriend finally get a hold of someone. They told us that our entire bag of laundry - not just the clothes that were scattered through out the hallway - was lost. It contained almost all of myself and my boyfriend's clothes and our sheets and towels. It's been 3 days and they still cannot find our laundry. In addition, they have absolutely horrific customer service. When we complained multiple times, were unable to get in contact, spent hours and hours on email and on hold- they had the audacity to suggest loosing the clothes was our fault because the bag of laundry we gave them was 'too heavy'. What?!? Shouldn't they be happy that we gave them business? And shouldn't they be hiring delivery and pick up people who can carry heavy packages? Please, please do not use these guys if you ever want to see your clothes again or if you don't like your underwear strewn around your building.

2.0,0.2293,"Let's be honest: I wrote a review for Cleanly because they prompted me in an email for a 15% discount on my next order. My experience since then has been unacceptable, though in their defense the gentleman I spoke with tried to improve the situation to the best of his managerial ability/privilege. I didn't pay for my wash and fold order in the end and I will be honest about that, however as I am now using my Cleanly laundry bag to walk to my friends apartment and do laundry there - I figured this would be a great time to update my review. Four out of five of Cleanlys' valet pick up employees have no idea how their system works or how to operate efficiently. My last order was dropped off and then the valet knocked on my door again after being 15 minutes late for the drop AFTER the one hour delivery window - asking me if he could scan the bag that he just left in order to update his system. I refused explaining that he was already 15 minutes late, making me late for a meeting and no: he could not have any more of my time at that point. This was the drop off experience, after receiving an email at 4 o'clock in the morning 2 days before saying that my card was declined, which ended up being THEIR credit card system error and they were unable to drop off my laundry as scheduled -  on that day holding both my clean laundry and more of my time hostage due to their malfunction. I could not go to work because I had no clothes. In order to rectify this problem, again - they didn't charge me for the wash and fold order however their system of holding your property hostage until payment is received, especially when payment was available and they ran the same card that day and it went through - was completely unprofessional, disappointing and downright awful. Saying ""I'm sorry"" is simply not enough and I would not recommend this service to anyone expecting an efficient, timely or professional experience.

They're still saying, ""We're sorry,"" but sorry doesn't replace my laundry that was lost five weeks ago--nor does it provide any reimsursement for my estimated $1000 loss.Update: Cleanly finally responded that their loss reimbursement policy is limited based on the weight--not the value--of lost items. That's one-fourth of the cost of my loss. They offered price reductions for future cleaning, but who would trust them not to lose clothes again?Shame on you, Cleanly.Steve K.Manhattan"
4.0,0.2156,"I would really really caution people from using this service. I have had one of the worst service experiences of my life with Cleanly. There was one occasion where Cleanly had my clothes and kept changing the delivery date and I had to work around them in order to attempt to get my laundry back. They apologized and I attempted to use them again. This last experience was the worst. When I received my clothing back I realized that my underwear ((which is normally packed separately)) was completely missing. When I reached out to Cleanly their responses were detailed and I was told I'd have to wait ten business days before they could do anything. I expressed the gravity of the situation considering what was missing and they pointed me to their terms and conditions and were not helpful. When they completed their ""search"" they gave me a minimal amount and stated that this was all I could get because of their terms. It is disheartening to say the least when someone essentially doesn't care about service would try and do the right thing, especially when they are the sole reason for the issue."

I used this service for almost a year without issue, but the last two months have been a disaster involving multiple lost items (first a tie, then a whole bag) and stained items and no follow-up whatsoever from customer service, despite our repeated notifications and attempts at contact. Don't do it."
1.0,0.2235,"Cleanly is great... Until you have an issue. Most of my orders have had no problems but today, they missed the delivery window(9-10). When I tried to call to find out where my laundry was, you can't speak to a person, you can only leave a message or send an email. Finally after waiting for 30 more minutes, I got a text that the ETA was for 10:55 and that a customer service rep would be in touch. That time also came and went and no one was in touch. I finally waited until 11:15 but I had to get to work so I had to reschedule my delivery, which they have charged me $5 for doing. The whole point of this app is the efficiency of being able to select a one hour window for pick up or delivery. Having to wait for over two hours is unacceptable, especially since this place is more expensive than any of the local spots. Looking forward to that call from the customer service rep, if it ever comes, as well as maybe one day receiving my laundry."

It is really frustrating when I make time to be home to have laundry picked up, and it's cancelled last minute. They didn't have a time for reschedule pickup until days later. For how much they charge, it's not worth being cancelled on and having to wait days. Also, they used to have many available times, but I've noticed lately they only have pickup times days later and at inconvenient times. I'm not using it again."
4.0,0.1947,"This company is the Bermuda Triangle of laundry services. I've used Cleanly twice and while the first experience was bad, this second one has been horrendous. Back in October, my hang dry items were left behind -- I had to call several times to get the items returned to me. Now, they've lost an entire bag of my laundry and it's been a massive headache to try to track it down. Did you know that Cleanly has 20 days to do a ""thorough search"" before your items can be deemed lost? Yeah, I didn't either since that information is not available on their website nor their app since the link to their policy does not work. On March 30, Matthew from the support team said he would circle back with the staff to fix the link so future customers would be privy to this preposterous rule but the link still doesn't work.I've emailed back and forth with the support team about reaching a conclusion but I get no more than the same lines parroted back about waiting 20 days before commencing the reimbursement policy. No business that values its customers would make them wait nearly 3 weeks to find out about the status of their items."

Do not be fooled by the ""convenience"" of this service...you'll end up spending more time dealing with their customer service and being stressed and frustrated than you would've saved.A few months ago, Cleanly somehow lost most of my 26 lb order of laundry. Returned to me at the dropoff time was some guy's clothing and couple of pieces of my own. After about a month of emailing back and forth with their customer service (and only receiving updates after following up multiple times), a couple of more items of my clothing were located and returned to me, but I still had to haggle for reimbursement for the remainder. They eventually gave me $750 (which is, honestly, generous, but still doesn't put a dent in replacing ~20 POUNDS of clothing from my closet that vanished on their watch) plus $250 in Cleanly credit. If this happens to you and they tell you the max they can reimburse you is $200, keep pushing. A few days ago I gave Cleanly another chance with my dry cleaning, since each piece is itemized unlike laundry, and because I still had this $250 credit to spend. Within less than 3 hours of the scheduled drop off time, I get a text saying unfortunately my clothing won't be ready and they need to reschedule. This is a minor inconvenience compared to most of my clothing being completely lost, but shouldn't happen to customers regardless. Needless to say I won't be using Cleanly again, and highly suggest you think twice before trusting this company with your wardrobe."

The first time, they wrote to me at the end of my pickup time that the valet was going to be 20 minutes late (when I was already late for work). They also wrongly charged me for dry cleaning when I had hang dry items. I was refunded, but their valets seem to be very misinformed.The second time, my pickup was cancelled 20 minutes prior, and I rearranged my entire schedule to make sure I was there for it. Not only that: once I received my order, I realized that they misplaced my hang dry items. I stressed to both customer services representatives that I needed these items before a trip and (obviously) it was not noted or taken seriously. I had to purchase new clothing for an event that I needed as a result. My compensation from Cleanly was $5.Additionally, I don't feel as though my clothes were clean. Some came back looking just as dirty as when I sent them off.The one thing I will commend is their customer service. Matthew was apologetic, polite and helpful during each of these instances. Unfortunately, he is one person and not a reflection of the company's service. I will not be using it again."

I will say that my clothes came back clean, but they lost one of my high end running socks.  Which now means I'm out a $16 pair of socks, because I can't just use one sock for running.  It took them 10 days to come up with a solution, which was ""here's $8 to use on cleanly"" or ""Here's $5 in cash"" Can't exactly replace my $16 socks with $5.  Needless to say, I will not be using them again or recommending them to anyone else.

Are you really sure you want me to answer this??? I think Cleanly sucks as a service and the ""concierge"" are a bunch of pompous jerks who speak down to you when you have a valid complaint. 1- Cleanly said my method of payment was not accepted (ApplePay)...so I went on and entered the exact card attached to that account and *magically* it worked. Btw thanks for letting me know at 9:15pm when I was in bed and needed to get up to grab the EXACT same card (did I mention that??) 2- My hang to DRY clothing came back wet, not damp, wet. I'm very accustomed to doing my own laundry and it was quite evident my items had been washed that morning. When I inquired I was met with a generic and frankly rude response essentially explaining the process of laundering to me....thanks for that. I was told there were many factors that influence why the items might come back wet, there was absolutely no accountability taken. If you washed the hang to dry items upon receipt, it would control many of the ""factors"", its laundry, not rocket science. 3- It was of poor quality and expensive. I've used other laundering services for half the price and my items came back in way better condition.4- You've lost me as a future client and if you have Yelp you can expect a ""lovely"" review from yours truly as well.Glad you asked.

3.0,0.2236,"My experience with this service was absolutely atrocious in a surprisingly varied number of ways. First and most importantly, when our multiple loads of laundry were delivered on Monday evening, a whole load was MISSING. When I contacted them about this, they said they'd take 7 business days (business days being Mon-Fri despite the fact that they are open on weekends, giving them a total of 9 days) to figure it out, and keep us apprised. After 3 days of our continuous checking in with no new information from them, they told us they had delivered the laundry to another customer and would send us pictures in the next couple of days to confirm. This never happened, and after continuous contact from us, they keep giving us the ""we will sort it out within 7 business days"" line.So, now it's Monday, a full week since the laundry was supposed to be delivered, and I am out of clothing. We don't know whether our laundry has actually been located or is missing, and they have been completely unapologetic, saying they have until Thursday to deal with it (I don't know who does their math).They have not even refunded this order!!! Additionally (and be *very* aware of this if you use this service), if our laundry does end up being missing, they will only replace each item with ""7 times the cost of CLEANING it."" Meaning that at $1.50/lb, a $15, 0.2 lb pair of underwear would get you a reimbursement of (up to!) 30 cents! At most we'd get $200 for clothes worth at the very least 4 times that.There have also been a fun assortment of other issues (the valet not bringing enough laundry bags necessitating a second pick-up the next day, delivery being delayed, a tiny bleach stain on a dark tee, a $20 groupon marked as having been applied to the total but them charging the full amount and it taking countless customer service interactions for them to fix this).At this point, I don't even care, I just want my laundry back. I will never be able to afford to replace what I lost given their reimbursement rates, and I loved that stuff.Outrageously bad. For your own sake I urge you to find another laundry service."

If anything goes wrong or there is inconsistency, they can still blame it on the vendor or say they are just getting started and bear with them. Nice to have interface, app, and text message, but simply paying a premium for same old laundry service. Laundry bag came back ripped after first try, gym clothes still smelt like sweat, socks and underwear not folded or inconsistently folded and some missing. Only had two try's so no horror stories like whole load went missing so I am sure some people had good experiences.Very similar to synergy maids who they were spun out of it. My first few tries with synergy maids were extremely inconsistent and frustrating but after raking management over the coals several times they finally got it right and are now quite pleasant and very convenient.

I was almost willing to use them again until they told me that it is not guaranteed when exactly they'd tell the dry cleaners that they failed to actually clean my clothes. As someone whose spent more than $500 over the past few months with Cleanly, I'd expect a refund and some coupons on top of that.

Valet was supposed to arrive Sunday. Called me asking for my address (which was already in the application and my order), then no-showed and didn't answer his phone. He subsequently claimed I was a no-show and charged me $5 for the ""no-show"". 2. 2nd Try Valet comes back on Monday. Arrives 30 minutes late, with no notice.3. Receive bill for ~$100, which included 30+ pounds of someone else's wash and fold clothing, as well as 3 sets of bedding (not mine), someone's dry cleaning.4. Received ""adjusted bill"" that was even higher, after I called support and relayed all these issues.5. Spoke to support again for 30+ minutes, who sent me pictures of clothes and items in question. I pointed out specifically which items were not mine, and she assured me that they would not be included in the delivery, and added that the valet would WAIT at the door and take back any other items that weren't mine. 6. Valet doesn't call or knock. I find the clothes outside my door, with no valet around. I have 30+ pounds of clothing that are not mine, dry cleaned shirts that aren't mine, and 3 sets of sheets and multiple towels that aren't mine.7. Clothes of mine are lost.For one that outsources their laundry, the notion of losing clothes is frightening, as you send off your often expensive clothing to a service with the promise that they are taking care and protecting it from being lost. For this to happen and the customer service associates to be so irresponsible is scary. I would recommend anyone to use RINSE, and NEVER use this service. Rinse I have never had a problem with and they are quick to apologize and fix an issues they caused with compensation or otherwise. PLEASE DO NOT USE CLEANLY."

However, they made a change in their concierge model (previously contract workers but they moved to hiring part time employees directly) and their hours became very limited, when they were running late they would often cancel and change the delivery to several days later (as one worker told me ""to avoid having to pay staff overtime"") and their prices went up as a result of this change. A service fee on all orders on top of delivery. This charge was even applied to people paying monthly for the Cleanly Reserve membership (which includes free shipping, etc). My last drop off instructions were not followed. I requested the clothes be brought to my door so I could ensure all the pieces were there, but they left the items with the doorman.  When my boyfriend picked them up, my hang dry items were not there.

He also mentioned someone would reach out to me - here we are 24 hours after that, and still nothing. No call, text, email, etc. nothing. He mentioned he'd give me $5 off my next order. $5? That's an insult seeing my order total was $120. My laundry was delivered - late again. No apology. Plus, my laundry was done differently than I specified. I asked cold water/light heat.

The bag accounted for 50-60% of our total wardrobes. We got the text message that the laundry has been delivered even though we did not receive it. We immediately reached out through  both email and phone when we realized we did not receive our laundry. We were consistently told that the employee was saying he had delivered it although he hadnt(at least to us). Cleanly-please help us find our laundry!Such poor execution is very frustrating. We have been paying 1.50 a pound -2x the cost of the usual service because we believed cleanly was more trust worthy then the usual laundry service .
6.0,0.1847,"First the good - Their wash and fold is great and I haven't had anything in wash and fold lost, other than a few socks.  They separate everything and the price is about the same as places in my area but I can schedule the pick up and delivery.  I don't have a doorman so this works best for me.  Their drivers also come within the window every time. They also do a hang dry for a nominal extra fee which is nice for my athletic gear.  Sometimes it still comes back damp though so I don't always opt for this.The Bad - They are consistently losing DRY CLEANING.  If I am dry cleaning an item, its probably a lot of money and I am pissed that its missing.  Their customer service SUCKS.  The last time they lost a shirt, they didn't even respond to me by phone or email.  Then, as I said it would be, it was at the bottom of the bag and not cleaned.  I will not be using their dry cleaning services again for this reason.  Also, twice the driver made me come down to get my things like out of my apt and walk to his car because they couldn't find a legal parking spot.  This is NYC, if you aren't willing to pay the guy's ticket or for another guy to stay in the car, then don't call yourself delivery.  One guy wasn't even near my building.  The laundry is heavy and this is a problem for me.  The app doesn't have a tip feature either.  Sometimes I tip in cash, but I don't always have cash on me and this is annoying. Also, their prices are a little high.  If their service was amazing, I could understand it, but it isn't - again their customer service SUCKS.  You are basically just paying for the delivery time.  If that matters to you, then use them.  If I had a doorman and could have laundry dropped off anytime, then I would never even use their wash and fold."
5.0,0.2622,"Bummed to have to give a bad review. Cleanly is so convenient and the delivery people are always friendly and on time. Since I've started using Cleanly, though, my collection of running socks is nearly extinct. They just never come back. I received an order back today that included one sock that definitely doesn't belong to me. As I'm now down to two pairs of athletic socks in a collection that was much larger, I have to be finished with Cleanly. I'm too scared of getting an order back in which clothing more irreplaceable than socks are missing."
5.0,0.2484,"Sadly, my first experience with Cleanly wasn't good. I had high hopes and was eager to love it because I hate lugging my laundry to the crowded laundromat 5 blocks away.The pick up/drop off and customer service is good -- it's easy to book a pick up/drop off, the people who come are friendly and professional and it's not hard to get someone helpful on the phone if there's a problem (which there was).The problem is they lost a few items and gave me a few items that weren't mine. I am not sure how something like that happens and the customer service people were nice in trying to help - but that doesn't bring my items back, or give me peace of mind that that didn't lose anything else that I didn't notice (I didn't keep track of exactly what was in the couple weeks worth of laundry I sent -- but you should I guess, if you plan on using them). For the price, they should be taking better care of your things.Unfortunately -- and important to know ahead of time -- the reimbursement policy is based on weigh of the item, and of course that won't be even close to equivalent in price that will cost to replace whatever they lost. So not only did I spent a lot on this service, I now have to spend more to replace what they lost. Sadly, not recommended."
5.0,0.1882,"I really thought this was the holy grail of cleaners when I first used them. The first few times my clothes came back perfectly folded, undamaged and smelling great. However, this changed quickly as the summer progressed. The last two times I used them, I found someone else's underwear and socks in my bag (with my own underwear and socks missing). I thought to myself ""no problem, this happens all the time."" The most recent (and probably final time) I used Cleanly, I sent off a very expensive custom made dress shirt and it was returned to me with the top button broken and the fabric around the top button torn all the way through (pictures attached). I've used many dry cleaners in the city, but none of them have cost me this much money in such a short period of time. I hope you guys have better luck."
5.0,0.2215,People don't write reviews unless the service was extremely good or extremely bad. This is the first time I had to write a review because the service was BAD. DO NOT use this company. They literally take your dirty clothes and place it on a hanger and put it in a bag to give the appearance of it being dry cleaned. The first time I used them I had brought a bunch of clothes to be dry cleaned and the service seemed good. But who can tell right whether clothes has actually been cleaned when the clothes are brand new and doesn't have body odor on it. But this second time using them the clothes I got back straight up had the odor still on it. As strong as when I gave it in to be cleaned! This must mean they are just taking the clothes and placing them on hangers and returning them back to customers! Do yourself a favor and go to your local and RELIABLE cleaner. This company is a scam.
5.0,0.2541,"Cleanly I started to use your service the moment you expanded to Midtown. I've been a big supporter of you and made sure I recommended you to as many people as possible. After spending the past 5 months and over $500, myself not including my boyfriend's account, I have to say goodbye. Growing a company is hard and I respect what needs to be done at breakneck speed in order to make sure you are using your investors money to expand to new markets. Issues will happen to anyone but adjustments must be made.Clothing is one of the most personal items that a company can get involved in, and losing items is something that no one wants. Our clothing connects us with our memories of people, places and much more. Although there was prorated compensation for the items I had receipts and online listings for, it still stings.Their detail receipts help you find out if something is missing from your order when you have ""tagged"" items like wash and press and dry cleaning, but a customer shouldn't have to use them to double-check the delivery was complete. They will come back to you at some point, just be vigilant. All of this are just variables that compounded on a decision that was really sparked by an email exchange that went public to us when their Community Manager Natasha B said ""I f*ing hate him"" regarding an exchange with my boyfriend and their COO saying ""He is such an a*hole. It will be an honor to send him away."" This type of language shouldn't be included in any email or chat, have we learned nothing about communication from other big PR issues with other companies?I write this as informative, not with malice or ill harm. Thank you for the fun ride, but I must say goodbye."

But now the worst thing happened. Light blue sheets, pillow cases, duvet and white socks came back pink. Devastating. Did they not think I would notice?  Did they think that pink is in?  So I sent an email and they offered to rewash. Thanks but no thanks. I rewashed myself. Bedding had to go to the trash. Socks are ok. But it's fall, I can hide them well. Anyway onward and upward. I guess they don't separate brights and colors. Will be using another service. It's been real cleanly .

The guy showed up 2 min early and i was 9 min late-TOTALLY my fault. They finally came and picked up my laundry after 2 1/2 hours of waiting. The app does not have the features that are listed when you join. They used bleach in my clothes, I am allergic, and I requested that bleach not be used. They never showed up with the cleanly laundry bag. My clothes came back wrinkled, and instead of using tide free and clear I'm pretty confident they didn't use any detergent at all. My clothes came back smelling like me. They should have at least smelled clean. I had to promotions, and if he gave me a discount for the inconvenience. My laundry only came out to $15, however it was not worth the time. Over four hours spent. The purpose of having laundry picked up connivence! Also if you're using an iPhone, when you review the customer reviews on that app, be sure to click on ""all versions"", and not just the ""current version"". The current version is very new and only has eight reviews, while all versions have 162 reviews."

Gave the company 6/8 of my dress shirts to wash and press. 30 minutes before they were set to deliver them they informed me they would be delayed 24 hours. I was leaving on a business trip so that was NOT acceptable. Requested them to just deliver my dirty shirts so I could get them cleaned at my hotel, but they informed we that was not possible because the facility was closed.So it is now right before my business trip and I have only 2 shirts for 2 weeks. The company gave me just $5 off my order... NOT helpful when I now have to pay for cleaning at the hotel or buy new shirts. Cleanly is NOT a reliable service. Definitely do not use if you are a business traveler."
5.0,0.2269,"We decided to try Cleanly after some negative experiences with Hamperville. Bad choice. On the plus side, their website and use of automated communications is far more effective. But they messed up our laundry service in almost every way possible. We specifically requested scent free detergent and our laundry came back reeking of detergent. They also sent us someone else's underwear. So we arranged for them to pick-up (with the stranger's stuff marked) and redo. The pickup was delayed more than a day. Then the return delivery was delayed twice. When we finally opened our laundry, the scent was gone, but the foreign underwear was still there. The whole process took a full week, and was not worth it. We're back to doing laundry ourselves."

I had a white sleeveless blouse that was shrunk significantly and has red/pink stains all over it which were not there before and a white cardigan sweater which has a burn mark and/or black plastic gunk melted into one side of it. Another white blouse doesn't seem as if it was washed at all. Overall I was obviously extremely disappointed in the service, never plan to use it again and will never recommend it to anyone.

I sent a brand new white dress to be dry cleaned before I took it on vacation (had only worn it one time). When I got my laundry back, I took the dress out of the bag to find an enormous brown liquid stain across the front that had not been there previously. The whole dress looked a shade dirtier as well. I emailed them immediately with pictures of the dress and a screenshot of the dress for sale online as I had recently purchased it. All in all, my dress cost $268 and cleanly only refunded me $125 plus some credit. I took a loss for their mistake and they took no responsibility for the enormous stain. They said their policy only allows them to reimburse 10x what it costs to dry clean the item- terrible policy if you plan to dry clean anything other than t shirts and undergarments. I'll never use this service again - they need to reimburse customers the appropriate amount for damaged items. They won't be in business for long if they keep treating loyal customers like this."
6.0,0.2567,"I loved using Cleanly for the first 4 months, then they lost three of my shirts (value at about $200 - one was brand new!) and offered a paltry cash reimbursement ($45) and credit toward future orders. Losing socks and underwear - fine. That's not at a great cost to me to replace and not unexpected from a laundry service. However, to say that the only value assigned to my clothing is based on weight is unfair and losing multiple shirts is not insignificant to my wardrobe or to my wallet. Also, providing credit is not appealing as I am now wary of trusting them with my clothing. As well, it took significant follow up on my end to get any traction on finding the items and on the reimbursement, which was frustrating.  Just this morning I had signed up for their VIP service, but have now decided to cancel."
1.0,0.2694,"Consistently late. Double charged. Overall, bad service.The past three orders I've put in with Cleanly have been delivered egregiously late. The most recent was supposed to be delivered between 7am and 8am on Friday morning. I was called at 8:30 am to be told that they would not be able to deliver until 7pm that evening and that they were still trying to determine where my dry cleaning was. After making me late for work and moving my delivery, they then charged me double and attempted to say they needed to keep both amounts on hold until my laundry was delivered. Still working to get them to credit back the extra charge. This was the third time Cleanly delivered my clothing late (as I write this, I still dont actually have my laundry yet so who knows when it will arrive). The previous two times, they delivered so late that I needed to move meetings around and hunt them down to find out when I could expect my laundry to be delivered - they have vague phone numbers and general emails so its impossible to get someone if you're having an issue."

I placed a new order, got it back, and looked at my receipt. They tacked on about 80 dollars worth of false dry-cleaning charges (they allow up to 12 hang-dry items that you place in a specific bag labeled ""hang-dry"" and they charged me as if they were dry-cleaning). This way, they got out of paying me for my lost shirt. To add salt to the wound, I discovered recently that they lost another 70 dollar shirt of mine. They do not pick up their phone when you call. I will never use them again and will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau/contesting their charges on my credit card."
4.0,0.247,"Cleanly in theory is really convenient - unfortunately in practice they've lost my laundry twice in the past three months and getting a refund is an obnoxious waste of time. In January they lost my dry cleaning and it took maybe 10 long (LONG!) emails back and forth with customer service before they'd accept that my clothing had been lost. Multiple emails from them asked me if I was sure I didn't have my dry cleaning, was I sure it wasn't folded in with the wash and fold, was I absolutely sure it hadn't been delivered. Obviously I'm sure and that's why I'm emailing. Had to wait the 20 day period and then when I emailed them on the 20th day for my refund it was more back and forth which resulted in half a refund for the cost of my dry cleaning and half in Cleanly credit.Then in March my boyfriend used Cleanly (not realizing that was the service that lost my dry cleaning) and they lost my hang dry items. We're currently in the 20 day waiting period for those and I'd bet my own life they won't find them and will try to issue us more Cleanly credits (as if we'd ever use them again) instead of a proper refund.Even if they didn't lose my stuff they're never (NEVER) on time returning your clothes. My 7:30-8:30pm delivery usually shows up around 9-9:30 and sometimes even later but that's really just the crappy cherry on top of the crappy sundae."

5.0,0.275,"At this point, it's my own fault for using them again when they've ruined so many of my items - I take responsibility for that, however I feel it's only right to let others out there know that they really aren't making any efforts to get better and change isn't happening. They're clearly more interested in building up profit than taking care of your clothes carefully. Seven months after the last incident, they've redesigned their app, but they're still paying no attention to taking care of clothing.That said, they tumble dried (again) my hang dry items. I put them in a separate bag as instructed, clicked the little ""hand dry"" button on the app and everything comes back clearly tumble dried, pilly, elastic sticking out - what happens to delicates when you put them in the dryer on hot. I would use extreme caution in using this service and not send sensitive items. They've probably ruined another $300+ of clothing because I chose to give them another chance."
5.0,0.4106,"Well my first review was January of last year so I have been using Cleanly for the whole year probably once or twice a month for $100+ each time.   They have gotten progressively worse.  I write on the app my preferences and in big BOLD permanent marker on the bags....cold water/low heat.  I have complained several times to them that they have shrunk numerous of my clothes to the point where they need to be thrown out.  They have offered me half hearted guarantees that those are the setting they use on my clothes and that all fabrics are different and blah blah blah. I have kept using them because of the convenience and I keep telling myself they guaranteed me it wouldn't happen this time.  But of course it happens each and every time.  This past time was the final straw.  I had to throw out 5 nice expensive sweaters that I have never had a problem with in cold water/low heat.  But for some reason cleanly uses cold water/low heat and they turn into toddler clothes.  I also included my all fabric cotton blend shower curtain which takes heat every time I shower.  Now it does not even reach down to the tub that is how much it shrunk. Every thing else was shrunk too but I was able to rewash and recover most of them to their original size.  so basically I had to pay to wash them and then pay again to wash them myself.   My clothes also come back with detergent stains on them, which causes me to have to rewash them as well.  All of these things I have brought to their attention and for some reason it never gets fixed.  So I am done with Cleanly.

6.0,0.248,"Had to downgrade my review after my most recent experience. My full length dress was crammed into a suit garment bag and the bottom of the dress was   Wet crumpled, defeating part of the purpose of sending it out. The biggest issue is that they put a stain on my top which did not have a stain on before going out to them. I contacted them to try and remedy the issue. Customer service was great, they responded quickly and organised for the dress and the top to be picked up free of charge to reprocess. Again, they collected in a timely manner as is customary for them, but the dress was returned in the same suit garment bag, crumpled again and the top was returned in the same state - with a stain. The top was an expensive (to me) silk Frame blouse which was a treat for myself last year. I have requested a refund for the ""cleaning"" of the ruined blouse and compensation for the cost of the blouse but have not heard anything. I am sad that they didn't respond because I would have given them another chance for past good service, but not anymore because they can't fix or acknowledge their mistakes. I would not want to send anything to them now for fear of them ruining it and not being able to acknowledge or fix the issue."

I replied back to the email from customer service and they said they would deliver it the next morning between 7-8am. PHEW...except it didn't come then either.

If there's no one available for the time I want, then it shouldn't be listed as an option on the app. At pick up, the valet did not have the bags as a first time customer as promised on the app. My drop off time then got pushed back a day again! On top of all this, the drop off time was supposed to be between 7:30-8:30am but kept getting pushed back and wasn't actually delivered until ~11:20am - almost 3 hrs late (almost making me late for work)!! If my laundry had come back perfect they might've gotten a higher rating. Unfortunately when I went through my laundry, I also had some socks missing and a tote bag that doesn't belong to me. Overall more stressful than I had anticipated. A positive was their customer service. Both valets were friendly despite having to walk up 6 floors and my total was discounted by 50%, which I appreciated given how much went awry with timing. Might consider giving them another chance but only after my disappointment with this first experience wears off."
5.0,0.2286,"I really wanted to like Cleanly. In fact, initially I did when I started using them about 6 months ago. However, the service has continued to decrease with every single order. The last order I received back my whites were completely tie-dyed with dark stains because Cleanly failed to separate my whites from colors as advertised. They tried to correct the issue by cleaning the whites again for free, which didn't do much for the stains but I was over it, and let it go. I said I wouldn't use them again, but I've been traveling like crazy and haven't had any time to do laundry. So for my convenience, I crossed my fingers and scheduled an order. I received my clothes last night, as as I'm going through them today I realize they are still wet. This is absolutely unacceptable. Cleanly is too pricey to offer such unsatisfactory service. I don't care if I have to hand wash my clothes, I will never use Cleanly again."

They swore they spoke with the guy who picked it up and he was absolutely certain he NEVER picked any pants up. After lots of back and forth, they agreed to reimburse me - most of which was just given as Cleanly credit. Several weeks later the pants magically showed up in their factory. No apology - no one reached out admitting that the concierge was wrong or apologizing for insinuating my doorman was lying to me.Several months later...several expensive items of clothing went missing from my wash and fold and I received some items that were not mine. Process to investigate missing items is too long (20 days) - had to buy a bunch of new clothing for a business trip.Too many issues make the service unreliable and thus I will be sending my cleaning elsewhere."

The customer service is pretty awful: they don't have a phone (or rather, don't answer it) so when you lose something you have to wait for email responses which come (roughly) every 6-10 hours. I asked for them to call me, or to give me the number of someone I could speak to repeatedly, they would not. Eventually, I got my clothes back. The bag was ripped and my laundry was no longer folded. All in all, just a really terrible experience. I definitely would not recommend.

They believe they went ""above and beyond"" because they actually reimbursed me for the price I paid for one sham, and the rest of the money was reimbursable in the form of Cleanly credit.

I messaged the business and it took them a while to get back and by then I was out of the country. So, all they ended up doing was manually crediting my account theb $50. But this is already after spending $30. So, the deal ends up being $80 for $50 which is nowhere near the same, especially since there are better and cheaper full service dry cleaners nearby. If they want business and good reviews, then they need deals and excellent service/convenience which I did not experience. I suspect they set up the checkout so you can't enter the deal easily the first time and end up getting stuck giving them more business. Would have gave then another star had they got the only stain I had on my 3 items."

Even the regular laundry service was good. However...the hang dry service was the worst, and why I had to give a 1-star review. I selected 12 items to be hung dry, mostly athletic clothes. They came back soaking wet in a sealed plastic bag, smelling worse than I could have possibly imagined. In all my years washing my athletic clothing, I've never experienced such a bad odor. The clothes clearly were shoved straight from the washing machine into the bag without so much as an attempt to let them hang and dry. My clothes (over $500 worth) are now ruined. They refunded me $10 after offering to redo the service, which I declined as they also said the ""hang dry is out of their control."" I took my ruined clothes elsewhere to try to salvage them. Unfortunately, I will never be using Cleanly again."

I lost a lot of money, because of course I was late for my flight and cab and etc. But thy did not even offer to make a refund for inconvenience.

1.0,0.4104,"One star because they eventually returned my clothing. Just kidding, one star because I can't give less than one star on Yelp. Also, I'm not trusting any review from Daryush, who clearly was asked to bring up ratings, and if ya'll get a code for reading his review, I'm sure Daryush gets some $$$ too. Let me tell you, nobody can offer me a discount big enough to use this service again. I have spent over 400 dollars at this business, ignoring some slightly annoying things like drivers being 10-20 minutes late, the occasional random underwear in my wash that isn't mine, and the perplexing things like how my shirt comes back more wrinkled after a wash and fold than when I put it in. I am telling you this, to highlight that I can be a reasonable person... Last Friday, I lost my sh*t.  I go to unpack my clothes, and find out they're not mine. Now, I reacted like any person would who felt their clothes were missing, but I calmed myself down and gave them a phone call. I called, because I don't believe this situation is one anyone wants to deal with via emails. Let me try to sum things up here... (but seriously, you should only need to read a reason or two before you are assured that you should not be a customer here) 1) I was placed on hold, then sent to voicemail. This happened repeatedly, and it was during business hours. Why was I told someone would be with me shortly, and then sent to voicemail?  I left a decent voicemail. Then a more concerned one. Then an impatient one. I never got a call back. 3) I sent an email, and that's when I had the pleasure of speaking with Melissa H., who needs to be sent immediately to every customer service training there is. Besides her canned responses (see all of her replies to reviews for examples), she ignored my request to speak with someone. When I later spoke to someone (more on that later), I was told that it's policy that Melissa can't pick up the phone and call. Listen, I wouldn't trust Melissa to handle a customer service call either, but at the very least, she could be instructed to state that policy instead of just ignoring a customer's request. Then, probably due to a lack of actual judgement and just a copy + paste response, the emails focused on picking up the clothing that wasn't mine. A reasonable request, if there were also some sort of CANDID acknowledgement that it's upsetting to have my clothes missing, some reassuring lines about the measures you are taking (this eventually happened when it was no longer reassuring), and maybe letting me know what would be done in the event my clothes were not found. 4) Dealing with something like this via email is like having a fight via text (don't). Nobody wants to sit there and wait by the computer for your responses to simple questions. You had one job (and I paid for it). You effed up that job. So you pick up the phone, so that someone can actually hear any sort of candidness in your voice, and so that you can field questions. 5) Well, since nobody called me, I had to use the power of social media. And wouldn't you know it. Less than 10 minutes after taking to Facebook and Instagram (I was so close to starting a Twitter for ya'll), I get a call from the manager. I had a very reasonable conversation with this woman because she's actually been trained in customer service, (please train the rest of the crew). 6) So my clothes were found the next day. Melissa and I continued our email conversation. She asked what time the following day I would be available to do a clothes swap. I say 10:30am. I had to email again to confirm that people would actually come at that time because I got zero response. Melissa emails me at 9:30am with the subject line ""you missed your pick-up/delivery"" -- At this point, I just gave up on her. Again, why is this so hard? I remind her in writing I said 10:30am because I knew I wouldn't be home before then, so now I have to wait until the night time on a Sunday to get my clothes. She says 9-10:00pm. 7) My clothes arrived late, because what else would you expect. My bathmat was somehow dirtier than when I sent it to be cleaned (the bathmat they charge you extra for because according to Melissa's canned responses, they take extra care for those items. Just.. lol) And of course, a handful of the signature more-wrinkles-than-ever clothing that Cleanly is known for. ***Once I took to social media, I noticed other people complaining with issues. I don't care what the issue is. I understand mistakes happen, but if you look, everyone's complaint is that they simply ignore you, refuse to call back, and just straight up not deal with the issue. Had someone called me back (or picked up like they should during business hours), and followed simple customer service guidelines, I would have likely forgiven the mistake*** NEVER AGAIN."

Earlier this week, we had Cleanly pick up several dry cleaning items as well as a very large bag (26 pounds) of mixed clothes. Dry cleaning was dropped off last night but our large bag of clothes is nowhere to be found. After contacting Cleanly, it is clear that Cleanly lost our bag. Appallingly, their first response was to offer us a $5 credit, which even if we had clothes left to wash and were stupid  enough to use Cleanly to wash them would cover only a small fraction of the cost.  They said they are currently contacting other customers to see if our clothes were mistakenly delivered to them and checking their warehouses."

5.0,0.3479,"We been using cleanly for about a year. It is more expensive than usual wash and fold places, but we figured the late delivery option/ease of the app/ease of payment was worth it (the only reason for two stars). A couple of months ago he started complaining about holes through the hems of his cotton shirts (all quality V necks, polos, undershirts) but I didn't think much about it. A few weeks ago my boyfriend asked if a white pair of athletic socks in one of the bags were mine. I said no and he tossed them. Right before Thanksgiving I found a pink Loft blouse and a pair of patterned J. Crew pajamas that did not belong to me. I know that some wash & fold places pin your clothing together and throw different people's loads into the same commercial sized washer/dryer, unpin, fold and deliver out. Given the random items we have received and holes I guess this is what has been happening. I am also starting to doubt that I (for the first time ever) neglected to re-pack two dresses and a bra and am pretty sure that some other woman got them delivered with her laundry...Also, for the price point socks could at least be matched up.P.S.- I told them to send a valet to get whoever's stuff I have and they told me they would with my next pickup.

I was there in my apartment the whole time waiting for delivery that never happened and they are yet to take responsibility and reimburse me for my stuff.2- They claim that they wash each customer's items in a separate machine.

6.0,0.2852,"I'm in the midst of sending my first order and given the problems I'm encountering came on here to check out reviews. I'm happy to see all the positive reviews but am actually quite surprised given the terrible customer service. Earlier this week I sent an email inquiring about the price of dry cleaning a queen-sized bedskirt, to which they responded that it would depend on the size and fabric and that they normally only do clothes. This was confusing since I gave the size and if an item can be dry cleaned it shouldn't matter the fabric. Also, they list a multitude of bedding items both in the wash and fold and dry cleaning sections so clearly they do more than clothing. I decided not to send my bedskirt and instead bagged up some towels and bedding to be washed and a few sweaters for dry cleaning. When I emailed again asking where to specify special requests (a few items need to air dry) I was told to leave them in the pickup/delivery instructions. I assumed this was for instructions regarding picking up or delivering the items since it gives options about leaving with the doorman, etc and not about how to handle the clothing. I was also informed that only 4 pieces can be air dried. What?? I don't understand the arbitrary number nor is it helpful if you're someone who regularly has things that need to air dry. In a subsequent email I was informed that the items may not dry in time and therefore would be sent back wet. What?? Why am I paying to have my things cleaned to have them sent back to me wet? I'm hopeful that this isn't an indication of how my items will be handled. The idea is great in concept but is missing the mark. I wish they provided more information on the website/app and also made the process of placing the order easier. I ending up taping notes to everything specifying if it was wash or dry cleaning and how it needed to be handled. It would be great if when placing an order they had boxes you could check to specify which items go where so you know that they know to dry clean your shirt and not launder it. At this point I'm just hoping my items come back to me clean and without any problems. I'll update next week when the order is returned."
4.0,0.2053,This is my first yelp review and I'm pretty fired up.  Cleanly was OKAY - until they lost half of my clothes and couldn't find them.  The whole process of considering my clothes lost took over a week.  When I first got my delivery back all i got was my sheets and towels... and someones else's clothing completely.  Good news they found out that this person had my clothes.  Not so good news it wasn't all of my clothes.  So while they ignored me for a few days it turns out today they cannot find the remainder of my clothing.  They offered $40 dollars based on their policy while I lost well over $300 in personal items - some that can't be replaced.  Clothes don't just disappear someone has them and Cleanly cannot backtrack to locate.  Instead of updating your app to a way less user friendly interface you should be working on a smoother process for ensuring clothes do not get mixed up and lost.

There is something to be said for a dry cleaner that you can actually walk into and speak with someone.  I understand that mistakes happen and if anyone was willing to get on the phone with me and just talk through the issue i would have given them a 2nd chance.

3.0,0.2163,"I made the mistake of not checking pricing before putting my laundry into the bag and handing it off to the valet. In my bag I included a blanket, which wasn't very big or thick and could have easily gone into a load with other stuff.  I was charged SIXTEEN DOLLARS additional- $40 for 18 pounds of laundry.  Granted, after double checking, I notice they do include this on the app, but that's insane!  I know this place is expensive and more of a luxury, but the price is so incredibly high for what you're getting, and not worth getting laundry delivery.  Would not use again..."
0.0,0.33,"Started off seeming lovely, ended up being a shabby service, poor customer service. They should be spending the money on washing and folding and returning the correct items to the correct customer rather than on expensive laundry bags and promotional brownies. The ""concierge"" arrived at my door with a promotional brownie and a cool looking laundry bag for me to reuse on future orders. They asked how I wanted things folded, scented, bleached, and options for drop off and pick up were flexible. Then my orders began being returned to me in worse and worse condition. Things were missing. Things were not folded. Items NOT BELONGING TO ME were delivered in my bag. They are not the personalized service they originally claimed to be. They ship your laundry out to a huge facility that loses your stuff and which cannot accommodate any special requests. By ""special"" I mean folding. I wrote to them, exasperated, asking if my towels and napkins can be folded individually rather than simply stacked stop one another and then bundled into one wrinkled fold. This is the reply: ""Our vendors are processing thousands of pieces a day and cannot accommodate specific folding techniques at this time. Unfortunately, we cannot process a refund for you for this matter. I also sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Please let me know if you have any further questions."" Wash and fold means wash AND fold. And returning ones own possessions should be a given. It's pretty basic."

I was called and screamed at by a crazy man for asking a very basic question about payment. He was frightening and I will NEVER use this service again."

Not once have I had a pleasant experience, but I continued to utilize their service as a result of my own laziness and some coupons I received. I've had multiple items lost, which as previous reviews have indicated, takes them a full week to search--and never once have I had them found. While they claim to return orders within 24-48 hours, I've had orders returned to me in 72+ hours--with no explanation and a measly $5 off my next order coupon. Not only that, their prices are outrageous for the quality. My clothes come back feeling brittle, usually extremely wrinkled, and lackluster--almost like they've aged a year. However, my recent order will be my last as my previously white towel came back blue with two large blue ink stains on them. The amount of problems I've had with every single order I've place with them is completely unacceptable, and honestly not worth the ""convenience"" of their service. I'd rather waste 3 hours at a laundromat then use Cleanly again! Avoid!"
